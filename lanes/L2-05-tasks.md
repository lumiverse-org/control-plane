# L2-05 — Lane 2 Atomic Task List

**Lane 2 — Pipeline & Evidence.** Subsystems **E** (Reusable workflow library) and **F** (Evidence chain store and query), spec §99.2 rows E and F (L9192–L9193).
**Branch prefix:** `lane/2/*` · **Merge-train position:** 3rd of 5 — `L1 → L4 → L2 → L3 → L5` (`PARTITION.md` line 35).
**Owned paths (exclusive, `PARTITION.md` line 18):** `.github/workflows/**`, `templates/workflows/**`, `tools/evidence/**`.
**Authority:** `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Code/implementation/PARTITION.md` is FROZEN and is never contradicted here. Spec of record: `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` (10,214 lines).

This file is the complete, ordered work list for Lane 2 — **76 tasks**. Work it **top to bottom**. Every task below is executable without opening another document. Do not skip, do not reorder, do not batch two tasks into one branch.

**Read §2.1 before you start.** Twenty-three ids that this file once published are defined in full by a phase file — `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6, `L2-02-digest-invariant.md` §3 — and that phase file is authoritative for them. This file carries an index entry for each and publishes its own, different work under `L2-T530`–`L2-T555` instead. No task text was lost; only ids moved.

> §33.2 (L2854–2869): *"Every required check name is therefore emitted by a job carrying no `if:` and no path filter."* Half the tasks in this file exist to make that sentence mechanically true, and none of them is optional.

---

> **Dispatch Routing Note (2026-09-08):**
> Tasks **L2-T001 through L2-T006** in this file are INDEX ENTRIES only.
> Their authoritative bodies live in `lanes/L2-00-charter.md §11`.
> Dispatch those 6 tasks from L2-00-charter.md, not from this file.
> All other tasks (L2-T007 onwards) are authoritative here.

## 0. Standing protocol — read once, apply to every task

### 0.1 Path ownership (hard)

You may create or edit files **only** under these three roots:

```
.github/workflows/**
templates/workflows/**
tools/evidence/**
```

You may **read** anything in the repository. You may **never write** to `contracts/**`, `schemas/**`, `registries/**`, `validators/**`, `reconciler/**`, `tools/provision/**`, `tools/records/**`, `metrics/**`, `access/**`, `infra/**`, `ops-vm/**`, `notify/**`, `assets/**`, `records/**`, `events/**`, `CODEOWNERS`, `Makefile`, or any root file. A pull request touching a foreign path fails the `lane-guard` check and is rejected (`PARTITION.md` rule 1).

**Namespace-package rule.** Do **not** create `tools/__init__.py`. `tools/` is a shared parent: `tools/provision/**` is Lane 3's and `tools/records/**` is Lane 4's. `tools.evidence` imports as a PEP 420 implicit namespace package. Creating `tools/__init__.py` is a foreign-path write and will be rejected.

**Additive-only discipline (`PARTITION.md` rule 5).** Prefer a new file over editing an existing one. Five tasks in this file deliberately edit a file created by an earlier task (`L2-T109`, `L2-T121`, `L2-T138`, `L2-T144`, `L2-T311`); every other task creates only.

### 0.2 Environment — set once per shell session, before any task

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
export CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree || { echo "NOT A GIT REPO - STOP"; exit 1; }
test -d contracts || { echo "contracts/ ABSENT - STOP (see 0.7 rule S1)"; exit 1; }
```

### 0.3 Git protocol — every task, no exceptions

**Open block** — run before the task's own commands:

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
git fetch origin
git checkout integration
git pull --ff-only origin integration
git checkout -b lane/2/<branch-slug>
```

**Close block** — run after the task's SELF-VERIFY prints `OK`:

**Commands**

```bash
set -e
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
git status --porcelain | grep -vE '^\?\? ?$' | grep -vE '^(A|M| M|\?\?) (\.github/workflows/|templates/workflows/|tools/evidence/)' && { echo "FOREIGN OR UNEXPECTED CHANGE - STOP"; exit 1; }
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration
git push -u origin lane/2/<branch-slug>
gh pr create --base integration --head lane/2/<branch-slug> \
  --title "<TASK-ID>: <task title>" \
  --body "Lane 2 (Pipeline & Evidence). Task <TASK-ID>. Owned paths only. SELF-VERIFY in L2-05-tasks.md passed."
```

Each task names its own `<branch-slug>`. One branch per task, short-lived (< 1 day). Never merge another lane's branch. Never rebase another lane's branch. Merge to `integration` only, never to `main`.

### 0.4 Deterministic output contract — binding on every `tools/evidence/**` program

Every program under `tools/evidence/` accepts `--summary` and prints, on `--summary`, **exactly one line** to stdout:

```
<STATUS> <tool-id> checked=<int> failed=<int>
```

| `STATUS` | Meaning | Exit code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OK` | executed; zero failures | `0` |
| `FAIL` | executed; one or more failures | `2` |
| `ERROR` | could not execute (missing input, unreadable fixture, absent contract) | `3` |

Any other non-zero exit is a crash and is a STOP. `<tool-id>` is the module's basename without extension. Diagnostic detail goes to **stderr**, never stdout — stdout carries the summary line and nothing else, because every acceptance command in this file compares stdout to an exact string.

**Fail-closed rule (§101 invariant 80, L9556 area; §33.2).** Every program in this lane that cannot determine an answer exits `3` and the calling workflow step fails. There is no "assume pass" branch anywhere in Lane 2.

### 0.5 Context-naming rule — read before writing any workflow

A required status-check context is the **name of the job in the workflow file that GitHub runs in the product repository**. A reusable workflow invoked with `uses:` reports its context as `<caller-job-name> / <reusable-job-name>`. Therefore:

* The **caller job name in `templates/workflows/*.yml` is the authoritative context name**, and it is spelled exactly as it appears in `templates/workflows/required-checks.yaml` (task `L2-T003`).
* Reusable-workflow job names never appear in branch protection and are free-form.
* You may not add, rename or remove a name in `required-checks.yaml`. If a task appears to need a context that is not one of the fifteen, **STOP** under rule S4 — that file is a published cross-lane interface (§53.1, L4653–4689; charter `L2-T003` STOP rule).

The fifteen published contexts, for reference while working (source: `templates/workflows/required-checks.yaml`):

```
phase_4: unit-tests integration-tests build security-scan licence-scan
         slopsquat-check contract-validation registry-validation parity-check
phase_5: verification-contract seeded-defect-case
phase_6: artifact-digest-recorded sbom-emitted
always : renovate-path-guard lane-guard
```

### 0.6 Six rules that never bend

Transcribed from the spec. A task whose implementation would violate one of these is a STOP, whatever the task text seems to ask for.

1. **Same digest.** *"The production artifact is the same digest verified in staging. Never rebuilt"* (§101 invariant 22, L9483; §32 L2803–2828; §33.4 L2887–2912). Never rebuild to work around registry unavailability (invariant 23, L9484).
2. **Approver ≠ deployer, fail closed.** *"The deploy workflow itself verifies that the recorded approving identity differs from the deploying identity and fails closed if it cannot tell"* (§27.2, L2567–2576; D73, L10156).
3. **Actor gate first.** The actor gate is the **first step** of `deploy-staging`, `deploy-production`, `migrate`, the rollback workflow and the production-restore workflow (§37.3, L3261–3268; invariant 18, L9477).
4. **No `if:`, no path filter on a required context.** *"no work was needed is an explicit recorded success, never a skip"* (§33.2, L2854–2869).
5. **Full-SHA action pinning, pinned-tag reusable consumption.** *"Every third-party GitHub Action is pinned to a full commit SHA. No tags, no floating branches, no exceptions"* (§48.1, L4300–4308; invariant 85, L9565).
6. **Record and event writes are required, failing steps.** *"the deployment-record and event writes are required, failing steps of `deploy-production.yml` rather than trailing best-effort ones"* (§97.2, L8843–8926).

### 0.7 Sizes

**S** under half a day · **M** half a day to two days · **L** two to five days.

### 0.8 STOP rules and the blocker template

Standing rules, from `L2-00-charter.md` §10:

* **S1.** A required file under `contracts/**` is absent or contains a placeholder → STOP. Do not invent the value.
* **S2.** Completing the task requires writing outside the three owned trees → STOP.
* **S3.** A rebase on `integration` conflicts outside the three owned trees → STOP. Do not resolve it.
* **S4.** The task requires choosing a name, threshold, format or ordering the spec does not state → STOP, file as DECISION REQUIRED for L0.
* **S5.** `git status` shows a modified file you did not intend to modify → STOP before committing.

If a task's stated STOP condition occurs, if any command errors in a way the task does not describe, or if a fact you need is not written in this file — **stop, commit nothing, and file the blocker below.** Do not guess, do not substitute, do not proceed to the next task.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
gh issue create \
  --title "BLOCKER L2-<TASK-ID>: <one-line condition>" \
  --label "blocker,lane-2" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
LANE: L2 Pipeline & Evidence
TASK: L2-<TASK-ID>
STOP RULE TRIGGERED: <S1|S2|S3|S4|S5|task-specific>

WHAT I WAS DOING:
<the exact command run>

WHAT HAPPENED:
<exact output, verbatim, including exit code>

WHAT I NEED TO PROCEED:
<the single missing fact, file, or decision>

SPEC CITATION:
MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md lines <A>-<B>, Section <N.N>

I HAVE NOT: guessed a value, written outside owned paths, edited contracts/**,
            resolved a foreign-path conflict, or continued past this point.
EOF
)"
```

Then post the issue number in the lane channel and take the next **unblocked** task, or idle. Never work around a blocker.

### 0.9 Task-id namespacing

Task ids are namespaced **by artifact tree**, per `L2-00-charter.md` §12, not by phase:

| Range | Tree |
| --- | --- |
| `L2-T001`–`L2-T099` | charter and lane bootstrap |
| `L2-T100`–`L2-T299` | `.github/workflows/**` |
| `L2-T300`–`L2-T499` | `templates/workflows/**` |
| `L2-T530`–`L2-T699` | `tools/evidence/**` |
| `L2-T700`–`L2-T799` | acceptance-test execution (AT-024, AT-029, AT-035, AT-103) |

**Ids are therefore not monotonic in execution order.** The `#` column of the master table is execution order; the `ID` column is identity. Work the `#` column.

### 0.10 Phases

Phase labels are the Build-track phases of `master/04-phase-map.md` §2, which is itself derived from §98.2 (L9006–L9090).

| Phase | Lane 2 content | Ends at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BT-0** | idle — `contracts/**` is L0's and is frozen first (`PARTITION.md` rule 2) | S0 |
| **BT-1** | bootstrap; `ci` reusable workflow only; the guards; the pin ledger | S1 |
| **BT-2** | `build` workflow, immutable artifact, digest recording, SBOM, parity | S2 |
| **BT-3** | `deploy-staging`, `deploy-production`, `migrate`, rollback, `restore-test`, `org-export`, `background-queue`; digest invariant in code; Friday-freeze gate; subsystem F end to end; all templates; AT execution | S3 |

**No lane opens a branch for the next phase until L0 declares the sync point passed** (`master/04-phase-map.md` §4).

---

## 1. DECISION REQUIRED — L0 must answer these

Six are carried forward from `L2-00-charter.md` §9 unchanged. Two are new to this file. Lane 2 must not resolve any of them.

| ID | Question, in one line | Blocks tasks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-L2-01** | Which lane owns the blast-radius `affected:` generator (§33.3, L2870–2886), the bulk fleet-migration PR script (§61.4, L5263–5280) and the change-matrix scaffold (§99.2, L9214–9231)? No lane owns `tools/fleet/**`. | `L2-T700` (AT-024 fleet half) |
| **D-L2-02** | The stable entrypoint and exit-code semantics by which `ci.yml` invokes L1's contract and registry validators, declared in `contracts/**`. | `L2-T106`, `L2-T107` |
| **D-L2-03** | The records-writer secret name, target repository, and record/event schema paths for `records/deployments/`, `records/uat/`, `records/restore-tests/`, `records/eval/`, `events/`. | `L2-T544`, `L2-T545`, and every workflow that writes a record |
| **REG-060** | The `make parity` environment-schema declaration format. §99.3 item 2 (L9232–9247) marks it **design-open**. | the *format*; **not** `L2-T108`, which only invokes `make parity` per the §33.1 command table (L2831–2853) |
| **D-L2-05** | The filename of the rollback workflow. §33.2's required list (L2854–2869) omits it; §27.2 (L2567–2576) mandates it; §37.3 (L3261–3268) names it among the five privileged workflows. | `L2-T133`, `L2-T309`, `L2-T554` (fifth workflow), `L2-T701` |
| **D-L2-06** | Lane-guard bootstrap ordering — L1 and L4 merge to `integration` before `lane-guard.yml` (an L2 file) exists. | DoD-20 for cycle 1 only; no task |

### D-L2-07 (integration): feature-branch merge criteria

**Canonical definition (FD-084, Option A).** A feature branch is merged to the integration branch when: (a) all CI checks pass, (b) at least one required reviewer approves, (c) no PARTITION conflicts remain open.

> RECONCILED 2026-09-09 per FD-084

### D-L2-08 (promotion): integration-to-staging promotion event

**Canonical definition (FD-084, Option A).** A promotion event moves HEAD of integration branch to staging branch, triggered by L0 manual dispatch or a scheduled weekly cut, authorized by bendrohit-eng.

> RECONCILED 2026-09-09 per FD-084

### D-L2-09 (release): release from staging after UAT sign-off

**Canonical definition (FD-084, Option A).** A release is cut from the staging branch after UAT sign-off, produces: tagged commit, SBOM artifact, deployment record in `records/deployments/`; sign-off required: bendrohit-eng.

> RECONCILED 2026-09-09 per FD-084

---

## 2. Master task table — all 76 tasks in execution order

Work top to bottom. `Deps` are task ids that must be **merged to `integration`** first. `Ph` is the phase of §0.10.

| # | ID | Ph | Title | Files touched | Deps | Sz | Acceptance command |

### 2.1 Ids owned by a phase file — index only, no body in this file

Twenty-three ids used to carry a full task body **both here and in a phase file**, naming different work, different files and different dependencies under one identifier (`L2-99-review.md` defect **B2**). That is resolved as follows, and the resolution is binding:

* **The phase file holds the authoritative body.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 owns `L2-T500`–`L2-T516`. `L2-02-digest-invariant.md` §3 owns `L2-T520`–`L2-T528`. `L2-03-production-gates.md` §7 owns `L2-T170`–`L2-T177` and `L2-T570`–`L2-T572`. Those bodies stay where they sit and are executed from those files.
* **This file holds an index entry.** The work this file used to publish under a colliding id is unchanged in substance and has been renumbered into the free `L2-T530`–`L2-T555` slots of the charter §12 `tools/evidence/**` band (`L2-T500`–`L2-T699`). Nothing was deleted.
* **Never execute a colliding id from this file.** If a dependency line, a test or a workflow names one of the left-hand ids below, it means the phase-file task, not the row beside it.
* **The charter is the fourth authoritative owner, and the last.** `L2-00-charter.md` §11 owns `L2-T001`–`L2-T006`. Those six differ from the twenty-three above in one way that matters: both copies described the **same** work, so nothing was renumbered — this file simply stops publishing a body under them. Their §2 rows 1–6 stand, their §3 blocks are index entries, and every criterion, command and STOP rule that lived only here is carried into the charter block it belongs to, under a heading beginning *Carried over from `L2-05-tasks.md` §3*.

`L2-T517`, `L2-T518` and `L2-T519` never collided and keep their ids here. `L2-T526`–`L2-T528` are `L2-02`'s alone and have no body in this file. `L2-T171`, `L2-T172` and `L2-T173` are `L2-03-production-gates.md` §7's alone: `L2-06-tests.md` cites them by id but defines no body for them, which is already the correct index form and is left as it stands.

**The table above is now the whole story — all thirty-two ids the two integrity sweeps raised, in one place.** Twenty-three were renumbered out of this file into `L2-T530`–`L2-T555`; three (`L2-T171`–`L2-T173`) were never a collision at all and are listed so no later reader re-opens them; six (`L2-T001`–`L2-T006`) were the same work published twice and are now bodied in the charter and indexed here. That is 23 + 3 + 6 = **32**. No id in Lane 2 carries a task body in two files.

**How to read a row.** The **Id** is what every dependency line, test and workflow in the lane means. The **Authoritative body** column is the only place to execute it from. *Now published here as* reads **index only — no renumber** wherever the two copies described the same work: once the duplicate body became an index entry there was nothing left to renumber, and the id keeps its number in the §2 execution table.

<!-- B1 CLOSED (FD-B1-L2 2026-09-02): L2-05-tasks.md is the authoritative task plan.
     Phase files L2-02, L2-03, L2-04 hold authoritative task bodies for the IDs listed below;
     execute them from those files. The old BLOCKED verdict is retracted. -->

**Subsystems G, H, J, O and P have no lane.** PARTITION v1 assigns A, B to L1; E, F to L2; C, D to L3; I, N to L4; K, L, M, Q, R to L5. G, H, J, O and P are unassigned, and Lane 2 does not claim them, plan for them or build against them. If a task in this file appears to need one, that is not a gap you close: STOP under rule S4 and route it to L0, blocker title `BLOCKER L2: task requires an unassigned subsystem (G/H/J/O/P), PARTITION v1 names no owner`.

**This subsection supersedes §10 note 2 of the earlier issue of this file**, which said the §2 table was the execution authority wherever a number collided. It is not. The phase file is.

## 3. Task detail — Phase BT-1, execution order 1–30

### 3.0 How to read a task block

Every block below carries the same fields, in the same order, and nothing else.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `#` | execution order, matching the `#` column of §2. Work this number, not the id. |
| **Phase** | BT-0/1/2/3 of §0.10. Do not open a branch for a phase L0 has not opened. |
| **Size** | S / M / L of §0.7. |
| **Deps** | task ids that must be **merged to `integration`** before you start. Verify with `git log origin/integration --oneline \| grep '<dep-id>'`. |
| **Branch slug** | the literal `<branch-slug>` to substitute into the §0.3 open and close blocks. One branch per task. |
| **Files** | every path this task creates or edits. Touching a path not on this line is rule S5. |
| **Spec** | the sections and line ranges that fix this task's content. Read them with `sed -n 'A,Bp' "$SPEC"`. |
| **Build this** | what to produce. It contains no choices. If you find one, it is rule S4. |
| **SELF-VERIFY / CORRECT OUTPUT / STOP** | one command block, its exact expected stdout, and the condition that ends the task. |

Set `SPEC` once per shell, alongside the §0.2 block:

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
export SPEC="C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md"
test -f "$SPEC" || { echo "SPEC ABSENT - STOP"; exit 1; }
```

**Every block assumes the §0.3 open block has already run** with that block's branch slug, and ends by telling you to run the §0.3 close block with the same slug. Neither is repeated in full inside a task.

### L2-T001 — Lane branch and owned-path skeleton

> **Index — `L2-T001` is not defined here.** `L2-00-charter.md` §11 `L2-T001` (*Create the lane branch and the owned-path skeleton*) is the authoritative body, including the A4–A6 criteria and the `S2` STOP rule this file used to hold alone; execute task 1 from there, on the charter branch `lane/2/phase0-charter`. See §2.1, `L2-99-review.md` and `_INTEGRITY.md` finding 4.



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Open block (§0.3)

### L2-T002 — Pin the consumed contract surface

> **Index — `L2-T002` is not defined here.** `L2-00-charter.md` §11 `L2-T002` (*Pin the consumed contract surface*) is the authoritative body, including the A4–A5 criteria, the `S1` STOP rule and the recorded lock-file-format difference this file used to hold alone; execute task 2 from there. The §2 row 2 acceptance command is unchanged and still passes against the charter's lock file. See §2.1.



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Open block (§0.3)
git fetch origin

# Capture the current HEAD SHA of contracts/ — STOP if contracts/ is absent (rule S1)
test -d contracts || { echo "STOP: contracts/ ABSENT — rule S1"; exit 1; }

CONTRACTS_SHA=$(git log --format='%H' -1 -- contracts/)

### L2-T006 — Rebase and open the phase-0 lane PR

### L2-T530 — Evidence toolchain skeleton

> **Index — `L2-T500` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T500` in full (*Phase-4 branch and the `tools/evidence` module skeleton*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T530`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 7 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** S · **Deps** L2-T006, **D-L2-07** · **Branch slug** `t530-evidence-skeleton`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/__init__.py`, `tools/evidence/requirements.txt`, `tools/evidence/README.md`
**Spec:** §99.1 L9184 area (a validator suite, a reconciliation engine, a CLI, a workflow library — scripts, not an application); §101 invariant 85 L9565 (dependencies pinned)

**Build this.** The Python package root for subsystem F, on the D-L2-07 ratification recorded in §1: Python 3.12, `==` pins, no lockfile generator. `__init__.py` exports one constant carrying the §0.4 grammar verbatim, so every later module imports a single definition instead of restating it:

```python
TOOL_CONTRACT = "<STATUS> <tool-id> checked=<int> failed=<int>"
STATUS_OK, STATUS_FAIL, STATUS_ERROR = "OK", "FAIL", "ERROR"
EXIT_OK, EXIT_FAIL, EXIT_ERROR = 0, 2, 3
```

`requirements.txt` pins every dependency with `==` and carries no range operator anywhere. `README.md` states the §0.4 contract, the fail-closed rule of §0.4, and the namespace-package rule of §0.1.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. `python -c "import tools.evidence as e; print(e.TOOL_CONTRACT)"` prints the grammar line.
2. Every non-comment, non-blank line of `requirements.txt` matches `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+==[0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`.
3. `tools/__init__.py` does not exist.
4. `README.md` contains the literal strings `checked=` and `fail-closed`.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
python -c "import tools.evidence as e; print(e.TOOL_CONTRACT)"
echo "UNPINNED=$(grep -vE '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' tools/evidence/requirements.txt | grep -cvE '^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+==[0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$')"
test ! -e tools/__init__.py && echo "NAMESPACE=OK"
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```
<STATUS> <tool-id> checked=<int> failed=<int>
UNPINNED=0
NAMESPACE=OK
```

**STOP** — if L0 ratified anything other than Python 3.12 with `==` pins, this whole file needs reissuing by L0. Do not adapt it yourself. Rule S4; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T530: D-L2-07 ratified a toolchain this file was not written against`.

**CLOSE:** §0.3 close block, `<branch-slug>` = `t530-evidence-skeleton`.

### L2-T531 — Action-pin resolver and applier

> **Index — `L2-T501` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T501` in full (*Pin the phase-4 consumed contract surface*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T531`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 8 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** S · **Deps** L2-T530 · **Branch slug** `t531-pin-tools`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/resolve_action_pin.sh`, `tools/evidence/apply_pins.sh`
**Spec:** §48.1 L4300–4308; §33.2 L2854–2869; §101 invariant 85 L9565

**Build this.** Two `bash` helpers. `resolve_action_pin.sh <owner/repo> <tag>` resolves a tag to its full 40-character commit SHA through `gh api` and prints one line `<owner/repo> <tag> <sha>`; it exits `3` when the tag does not resolve and never prints a partial line. `apply_pins.sh` reads `tools/evidence/action-pins.txt` and rewrites every `PIN:<owner/repo>` placeholder in `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `templates/workflows/*.yml` to `<owner/repo>@<sha> # <tag>`; it is idempotent, and it exits `3` changing nothing when a placeholder has no ledger row. Neither script writes outside the three owned trees.

### L2-T532 — Action pin ledger

> **Index — `L2-T502` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T502` in full (*Author `tools/evidence/eleven-questions.yaml`*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T532`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 9 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** S · **Deps** L2-T531 · **Branch slug** `t532-pin-ledger`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/action-pins.txt`
**Spec:** §48.1 L4300–4308 (*"pinned to a full commit SHA. No tags, no floating branches, no exceptions"*); §101 invariant 85 L9565

**Build this.** One ledger row per third-party action this lane ever uses, each row exactly `<owner/repo> <tag> <sha>` with a 40-hex SHA, every SHA produced by `resolve_action_pin.sh` and never by hand. Add a row when a workflow first needs the action; never delete a row. The ledger is the only place a SHA is written down, and `apply_pins.sh` is the only thing that copies one into a workflow.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
: > tools/evidence/action-pins.txt
for PAIR in "actions/checkout v4"; do
  bash tools/evidence/resolve_action_pin.sh $PAIR >> tools/evidence/action-pins.txt
done
git add tools/evidence/action-pins.txt
git commit -m "L2-T532: action pin ledger"
```

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Every line matches `^[a-z0-9._/-]+ v[0-9.]+ [0-9a-f]{40}$`. No line is exempt.
2. No `owner/repo` appears twice.
3. No workflow under `.github/workflows/` or `templates/workflows/` references an action by tag or branch — every `uses:` of a third-party action carries `@<40-hex>`.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
echo "ROWS=$(grep -cE '^[a-z0-9._/-]+ v[0-9.]+ [0-9a-f]{40}$' tools/evidence/action-pins.txt)"
echo "MALFORMED=$(grep -cvE '^[a-z0-9._/-]+ v[0-9.]+ [0-9a-f]{40}$' tools/evidence/action-pins.txt)"
echo "DUPES=$(cut -d' ' -f1 tools/evidence/action-pins.txt | sort | uniq -d | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT** (`ROWS` equals the number of distinct actions the lane uses so far; at this task it is `1`)

```
ROWS=1
MALFORMED=0
DUPES=0
```

**STOP** — if an action you need publishes no tag, or resolves to a SHA that changes between two runs of `resolve_action_pin.sh`, do not pin the branch and do not vendor the action. Rule S4; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T532: <owner/repo> cannot be pinned to a stable full SHA`.

### L2-T533 — Workflow lint: pinning, permissions, no-`if:`

See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 10 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T532 · **Branch slug** `t533-lint-workflow`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/lint_workflow.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/lint/**`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 (path filters, `if:`, SHA pinning, least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN`); §48.1 L4300–4308

**Build this.** The lint every later workflow task is graded by. `python -m tools.evidence.lint_workflow --path <file-or-dir> --summary` applies five rules to each workflow file and prints one §0.4 line with tool-id `lint_workflow`:

| Rule | Fails when |
| --- | --- |
| `LW-01` | a `uses:` of a third-party action is not `@<40-hex>` |
| `LW-02` | a job emitting a name listed in `required-checks.yaml` carries an `if:` |
| `LW-03` | the workflow carries `paths:` or `paths-ignore:` |
| `LW-04` | `permissions:` is absent, or grants a `write` scope the workflow does not use |
| `LW-05` | a step declares `continue-on-error: true` on a job emitting a required context |

`checked=` counts workflow files examined; `failed=` counts rule violations. Fixtures: `fixtures/lint/good.yml` (passes all five) and exactly five one-violation files `bad_lw01.yml` … `bad_lw05.yml`.

### L2-T534 — Required-context ↔ job cross-check

> **Index — `L2-T504` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T504` in full (*Implement `tools/evidence/evidence-query`*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T534`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 11 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T533 · **Branch slug** `t534-context-crosscheck`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/check_required_contexts.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/contexts/**`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869; §53.1 L4653–4689; §0.5 of this file (the caller job name is the authoritative context name)

**Build this.** The tool that proves the published registry and the workflows agree. It reads a registry file and resolves each context by group, per §0.5:

* contexts in the `phase_4`, `phase_5` and `phase_6` groups must be emitted by a **caller job in the `--templates` tree**, because those are the names GitHub reports in the product repository;
* contexts in the `always` group must be emitted by a **job in `.github/workflows/`**, because `lane-guard` and `renovate-path-guard` run in the control plane, not from a per-product caller.

It fails on any of three conditions: a registry context emitted by no job in its resolving tree; a caller job in the `--templates` tree that calls a control-plane reusable workflow which emits a registry context, but whose own job name is not in the registry (templates that emit no required status context are exempt from this condition — L2-T303–309 templates legitimately emit none and must not trigger this failure); a job emitting a registry context that carries an `if:` or sits in a workflow with a path filter. `checked=` counts registry contexts; `failed=` counts violations. Tool-id `check_required_contexts`.

Fixtures under `fixtures/contexts/`: `registry.yaml` carrying exactly 3 contexts, all in `phase_4` so the fixtures exercise the template arm only; `ok/` with 3 matching caller jobs, `missing/` with 2, `extra/` with 4.



```python
# File: tools/evidence/check_required_contexts.py
# Created by L2-T534
# Usage: python -m tools.evidence.check_required_contexts
#          --templates <dir> --registry <file> [--summary]
# Spec: §33.2 L2854-2869; §53.1 L4653-4689; L2-05-tasks.md §0.5

"""
Required-context <-> job cross-check.

Reads the required-checks.yaml registry and resolves each context:
  phase_4/5/6: must be emitted by a caller job in the --templates tree
  always:      must be emitted by a job in .github/workflows/

Fails on:
  - A registry context emitted by no job in its resolving tree
  - A caller job in templates that calls a control-plane reusable workflow
    emitting a registry context, but whose own job name is not in the registry
  - A job emitting a registry context that carries an if: or sits in a workflow

### L2-T100 — `ci.yml` reusable scaffold

**#** 14 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T532, L2-T533 · **Branch slug** `t100-ci-scaffold`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869; §33.4 L2887–2912 (the pipeline shape)

**Build this.** The reusable workflow shell only — `on: workflow_call` with its declared inputs and secrets, top-level `permissions: contents: read`, a `concurrency` group keyed on the calling ref, and **no jobs yet beyond a single `no-op` placeholder job that reports success explicitly**. Every third-party `uses:` carries a full SHA from the ledger. No `if:`, no path filter, anywhere in the file, at this or any later `ci.yml` task.



```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml (initial scaffold — L2-T100)
# Spec: §33.2 L2854-2869; §33.4 L2887-2912

# permissions: contents: read — no write scope.
# No if:, no paths:, no paths-ignore: anywhere in this file.
# Every third-party uses: must carry a full 40-hex SHA from the action-pins ledger.
# The no-op job reports explicit success; it is replaced by L2-T101.

### L2-T101 — `ci.yml`: `unit-tests`, `integration-tests`

**#** 15 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T100 · **Branch slug** `t101-ci-tests`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (edit, additive — one of the five permitted edits, §0.1)
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 (*"Every push triggers: unit tests, integration tests, …"*); §98.2 L9006–9090 (CI contexts arrive at Phase 4)

**Build this.** Two jobs, named exactly `unit-tests` and `integration-tests` to match `required-checks.yaml`. Each invokes the per-product command through the caller-supplied input, carries no `if:`, and reports an explicit success when the product declares no suite of that kind — *no work was needed is an explicit recorded success*. Remove the `no-op` placeholder job of `L2-T100` in the same commit.



```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/ci.yml (edited — L2-T101, additive)
# Replaces the no-op placeholder job with unit-tests and integration-tests.
# Both jobs are named exactly as published in required-checks.yaml.
# Neither carries an if:. No path filter anywhere in the file.
# The no-work path exits 0 after echoing a literal reason — never exit 78, never skipped.
# Spec: §33.2 L2854-2869; "no work was needed is an explicit recorded success, never a skip"

# (Shown as the replacement jobs section; full file retains all scaffold fields above)

### L2-T102 — `ci.yml`: interim `build` job

**#** 16 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** S · **Deps** L2-T101 · **Branch slug** `t102-ci-build-interim`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869; §33.4 L2887–2912

**Build this.** A job named exactly `build` that compiles or packages and reports a real conclusion. It is **interim**: `L2-T121` replaces its body with a call to `build.yml` once `L2-T120` lands. It must exist now because the context `build` is published in `required-checks.yaml` and an unpublished required context blocks every pull request indefinitely (§98.2 L9006–9090). It emits no digest and no SBOM yet — those contexts belong to phase 6 of the registry and to `L2-T120`.



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Append the interim build job to ci.yml (additive — L2-T101 already exists)
# The interim build job will be replaced in L2-T121 when build.yml lands.
# It MUST NOT emit artifact-digest-recorded or sbom-emitted (phase-6 contexts).

```

**Acceptance criteria**

1. A job named exactly `build` exists and carries no `if:`.
2. The file still declares zero path filters.
3. `lint_workflow` is clean.
4. The job does **not** emit the contexts `artifact-digest-recorded` or `sbom-emitted` — those arrive with `L2-T120`.

### L2-T103 — `ci.yml`: `security-scan`, delta-gated

**#** 17 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T102, L2-T536 · **Branch slug** `t103-ci-security`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 (delta gating on security findings); §48.2 L4309–4316

**Build this.** A job named exactly `security-scan` that runs the scanner, then pipes its findings through `python -m tools.evidence.delta_gate` against the stored baseline. The job fails on new findings only. A legacy finding neither fails the job nor is silently discarded: the job prints the legacy count to the log. A missing baseline is `ERROR` from the delta gate and fails the job — the job never treats an absent baseline as a clean tree.



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Append security-scan job to ci.yml.
# The failure decision is the delta gate's exit code, not the scanner's.
# A missing baseline is ERROR from delta_gate and fails the job (fail-closed rule).

**Acceptance criteria**

1. A job named exactly `security-scan` exists, carries no `if:` and no `continue-on-error`.

### L2-T104 — `ci.yml`: `licence-scan`, delta-gated

**#** 18 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T103 · **Branch slug** `t104-ci-licence`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Spec:** §48.2 L4309–4316 — *"CI fails on newly introduced licence findings only"*; the scanner's policy configuration is a control-plane artifact

**Build this.** A job named exactly `licence-scan`, structurally identical to `security-scan` and using the **same** `delta_gate` engine with the licence baseline. The licence policy configuration is read from the control plane as a declared input; the job never carries a policy inline. A finding against an existing dependency does not fail the job and is printed to the log with its identity so technical-debt governance can pick it up (§48.2, §56).



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Append licence-scan job to ci.yml.
# Structurally identical to security-scan; uses the SAME delta_gate engine.
# Licence policy configuration is read from control plane as a declared input —
# NO policy is hard-coded in the workflow file.
# A legacy finding prints its identity to the log but does not fail the job.

### L2-T106 — `ci.yml`: `contract-validation` and §33.1 required-file presence

**#** 20 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T105, **D-L2-02** · **Branch slug** `t106-ci-contract`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Spec:** §33.1 L2831–2853 (the required-file list); §15.5 L1564–1582 (what CI validation fails on)

**Build this.** A job named exactly `contract-validation` doing two things. First, it invokes Lane 1's contract validator through the entrypoint declared in `contracts/**` under D-L2-02 — Lane 2 calls it, never reimplements it. Second, it asserts the presence of every §33.1 required file in the product repository, exactly this list and no other:

```
.env.example
docker-compose.dev.yml
Makefile
seed data
migration directory
verification/
AGENTS.md
product.yaml (or a pointer to the product it belongs to)
```

*"Required-file presence is checked, not assumed"* (§33.1). A missing file fails the job on the same terms as a `product.yaml` missing a field.

[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Append parity-check job to ci.yml.

### L2-T109 — Extend `lane-guard.yml` with lint and context cross-check

**#** 23 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T534, L2-T108 · **Branch slug** `t109-lane-guard-lint`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/lane-guard.yml` (edit — one of the five permitted edits, §0.1)
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869; §53.1 L4653–4689

**Build this.** Two additional steps inside the existing `lane-guard` job — not new jobs, because the context name is fixed and published. Step: run `lint_workflow` over `.github/workflows` and `templates/workflows`. Step: run `check_required_contexts` over `templates/workflows` against `required-checks.yaml`. Either non-zero exit fails the `lane-guard` context. The job still carries no `if:` and no path filter.

cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Edit lane-guard.yml (one of the five permitted edits per §0.1).

### L2-T110 — `renovate-path-guard.yml`

**#** 24 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T532 · **Branch slug** `t110-renovate-guard`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/renovate-path-guard.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 — the Renovate disposition policy, ruleset A/B split, and *"The authorship half is not optional"*

**Build this.** A workflow emitting the required context `renovate-path-guard`, on `pull_request`, one job of that exact name, no `if:`, no path filter. It fails a Renovate pull request when **either** is true:

1. the diff touches a file outside the declared manifest and lockfile paths; **or**
2. **any** commit on the branch was authored **or** committed by an identity other than the Renovate app.

Both halves are implemented. A commit on a bypass-actor branch authored by another identity is Blocking drift (§53), so the guard fails and says so in the log with the literal string `FOREIGN_AUTHOR`. The guard lives in ruleset B, which carries **no** bypass actor — the workflow does not need to know that, but it must never grant an exemption of its own.



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Create .github/workflows/renovate-path-guard.yml.
# RULES (all binding, §33.2):
#   - Job name exactly renovate-path-guard
#   - No if:, no path filter
#   - Path half: fails if diff touches files outside declared manifest/lockfile paths
#   - Authorship half: fails if any commit (not just HEAD) was authored/committed
#     by a non-Renovate identity — emits FOREIGN_AUTHOR literal
#   - No allow-list exempting any identity
#   - Ruleset B (no bypass actor) is enforced at the GitHub level; this workflow

### L2-T111 — `control-plane-ci.yml` — §15.5 control-plane validation

**Build this.** The control-plane repository's own CI. It runs on `push` and `pull_request` against the control plane itself and invokes the Lane 1 validators over `registries/**` and the product contracts, failing the build on any §15.5 condition. Lane 2 owns the **job**, never the rules. The two §15.5 bullets that are Lane 2's own to assert — *"a product with a `recovery:` block and no `restore-production.yml`"* and template drift — arrive later at `L2-T144`, once the template manifest exists.

### L2-T537 — Negative-test harness for the two guards

> **Index — `L2-T507` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T507` in full (*Implement `tools/evidence/collect-version.sh`*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T537`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 26 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T109, L2-T110 · **Branch slug** `t537-negative-tests`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/negative/**`, `tools/evidence/run_negative_tests.sh`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869; `L2-00-charter.md` §7 DoD-06, DoD-07, DoD-11

**Build this.** The harness that proves the guards actually fail. Exactly six cases, each a fixture plus an expected exit code:

| Case | Fixture | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `N1` | a foreign-path diff on a `lane/2/*` branch | lane-guard fails |
| `N2` | a branch matching no `lane/[1-5]/*` prefix | lane-guard fails closed |
| `N3` | a required-context job carrying an `if:` | `lint_workflow` fails (DoD-06) |
| `N4` | a run reporting `skipped` on a required context | `assert_run_conclusions` fails (DoD-07) |
| `N5` | a Renovate diff outside the declared manifest paths | renovate guard fails (DoD-11) |
| `N6` | a Renovate branch with a commit authored by another identity | renovate guard fails, log contains `FOREIGN_AUTHOR` (DoD-11) |

`run_negative_tests.sh --summary` prints one §0.4 line with tool-id `run_negative_tests`: `checked=` is the number of cases, `failed=` is the number of cases whose guard did **not** fail. A guard that passes a negative case is the failure being measured.

### L2-T112 — `publish-workflow-tag.yml` — immutable `workflows/vN` release

**#** 27 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T532 · **Branch slug** `t112-publish-tag`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/publish-workflow-tag.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 — *"a tag ruleset blocking updates and deletions on `workflows/*` with an empty bypass-actor list"*, workflow releases published immutably; §61.1 L5215 area (changing a reusable workflow is a platform change)

**Build this.** A `workflow_dispatch` workflow that cuts a new `workflows/vN` tag from the control plane's default branch, refusing to move or delete an existing one. It resolves the tag's commit SHA and prints it, because that SHA sits in Lane 3's §53.1 reconciliation comparison set. It does **not** create the tag ruleset — protection is `access/**`, Lane 5's tree — and it fails closed with the literal string `TAG_ALREADY_EXISTS` when the tag is present.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }

### L2-T300 — Template tree and placeholder contract

**#** 28 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** S · **Deps** L2-T006, **D-L2-08** · **Branch slug** `t300-template-contract`
**Files:** `templates/workflows/README.md`, `templates/workflows/PLACEHOLDERS.yaml`
**Spec:** §19.1 L1826–1882 (templates are consumed by `create-product`); §33.2 L2854–2869 (all required workflows are generated from templates at product creation); `PARTITION.md` rule 4

**Build this.** The template tree's own contract, on the D-L2-08 ratification recorded in §1. `PLACEHOLDERS.yaml` declares exactly five tokens and nothing else:

```
{{PRODUCT_NAME}}
{{CONTROL_PLANE_REPO}}
{{WORKFLOWS_TAG}}
{{CONFORMANCE_PROFILE}}
{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}
```

`README.md` states: substitution is performed by `create-product` (Lane 3), never by Lane 2; **no token may appear inside a GitHub Actions `${{ }}` expression**; a template is consumed by pinned tag, never by branch (§33.3, §48.1).



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Create templates/workflows/README.md and templates/workflows/PLACEHOLDERS.yaml.

# Per-product workflow caller templates — Spec §19.1 L1826-1882, §33.2 L2854-2869

## Purpose

`create-product` (Lane 3, Subsystem D) copies these files into a new product
repository under `.github/workflows/`, substituting the `{{UPPER_SNAKE_CASE}}`
placeholders declared in `PLACEHOLDERS.yaml` from `product.yaml` values.

**The substituting component is `create-product` (Lane 3).** Lane 2 authors the
templates and lints them with `tools/evidence/render_template.py`. Lane 2 never
performs substitution into a product repository — that would be a foreign-path
write (PARTITION.md rule 1, §0.1 of L2-05-tasks.md).

## Placeholder rules (binding, no exceptions)

1. Every token used in a template must be declared in `PLACEHOLDERS.yaml`.
2. Every declared token must be used by at least one template.
3. **No token may appear inside a GitHub Actions `${{ }}` expression.**
   A `{{PRODUCT_NAME}}` inside `${{ }}` produces invalid YAML after substitution.
4. Templates are consumed by `{{WORKFLOWS_TAG}}` (a pinned tag), never by branch.
   Consuming by branch defeats the tag protection and the blast-radius apparatus
   of §33.3 and invariant 72.

## Required workflows per product repository (§33.2)

| Template | Required when |
|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | always |
| `build.yml` | always |
| `deploy-staging.yml` | always |
| `deploy-production.yml` | always |
| `migrate.yml` | always |
| `restore-test.yml` | always |
| `restore-production.yml` | product declares a `recovery:` block (§44.5) |
| `background-queue.yml` | conditional on §37.6 benchmark gate |
| `rollback.yml` | D-L2-05 (decision required) |

## Lint

```bash
python -m tools.evidence.render_template --lint templates/workflows --summary
```

## fail-closed rule

If `render_template` cannot validate a template (missing PLACEHOLDERS.yaml,
unreadable file, malformed YAML after substitution), it exits 3 (`ERROR`) and
the calling workflow step fails. There is no "assume pass" branch.

## checked= count

`render_template --lint` counts template `.yml` files examined. A run over an
empty directory is `OK render_template checked=0 failed=0`, exit 0 — not an error.

**Build this.** Three modes, one module, tool-id `render_template`:

* `--lint <dir>` — every token used in a template is declared in `PLACEHOLDERS.yaml`; every declared token is used by at least one template; no token sits inside a `${{ }}` expression. `checked=` counts template files.
* `--render <file> --values <yaml>` — substitutes and prints to stdout, for Lane 2's own testing only. Lane 3's `create-product` is the production renderer; this mode never writes into a product repository.
* `--manifest <file>` — validates `templates/workflows/MANIFEST.yaml` (used from `L2-T311`).

Fixtures under `fixtures/render/`: `ok/` (2 templates, all tokens declared and used), `undeclared/` (1 template using `{{NOPE}}`), `nested/` (1 template with a token inside `${{ }}`).

# Template renderer and placeholder lint — L2-T539.
# Spec §19.1 L1826-1882; PARTITION.md rule 4.
#
# Three modes (tool-id: render_template):
#   --lint <dir>      Every token used in templates is declared in PLACEHOLDERS.yaml;
#                     every declared token is used by at least one template;
#                     no token sits inside a ${{ }} expression.
#   --render <file> --values <yaml>  Substitutes and prints to stdout only.
#                     NEVER writes into a product repository (that is Lane 3).
#   --manifest <file>  Validates templates/workflows/MANIFEST.yaml (L2-T311).
#
# Output contract (§0.4): one line to stdout when --summary:
#   OK render_template checked=<int> failed=<int>   exit 0
#   FAIL render_template checked=<int> failed=<int> exit 2
#   ERROR render_template checked=0 failed=0        exit 3
#
# Diagnostics go to stderr; stdout carries the summary line only.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. `--lint fixtures/render/ok` → `OK render_template checked=2 failed=0`, exit `0`.
2. `--lint fixtures/render/undeclared` → `FAIL render_template checked=1 failed=1`, exit `2`.
3. `--lint fixtures/render/nested` → `FAIL render_template checked=1 failed=1`, exit `2`.
4. `--render` writes no file anywhere; it prints to stdout only.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

  python -m tools.evidence.render_template --lint tools/evidence/fixtures/render/$D --summary; echo "EXIT=$?"
done
python -m tools.evidence.render_template --lint templates/workflows --summary; echo "EXIT=$?"
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT** (the last pair is the real template tree, which at this task holds no `.yml` template yet)

```
OK render_template checked=2 failed=0
EXIT=0
FAIL render_template checked=1 failed=1
EXIT=2
FAIL render_template checked=1 failed=1
EXIT=2
OK render_template checked=0 failed=0
EXIT=0
```

**STOP** — do not implement substitution into a product repository. That is `tools/provision/**`, Lane 3's tree. Rule S2; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T539: asked to render templates into a product repository`.

**CLOSE:** §0.3 close block, `<branch-slug>` = `t539-render-template`.

### L2-T301 — `templates/workflows/ci.yml`

**#** 30 · **Phase** BT-1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T539, L2-T108 · **Branch slug** `t301-template-ci`
**Files:** `templates/workflows/ci.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 (required workflows per repository, generated from templates, consumed by pinned tag); §0.5 of this file (the caller job name is the authoritative context name)

**Build this.** The per-product caller. One job per phase-4 and phase-5 context, each named **exactly** as `required-checks.yaml` spells it, each calling `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in `{{CONTROL_PLANE_REPO}}` at `{{WORKFLOWS_TAG}}` — a pinned tag, never a branch. No job carries an `if:`; the file carries no path filter. The eleven caller jobs are:

```
phase_4: unit-tests  integration-tests  build  security-scan  licence-scan
         slopsquat-check  contract-validation  registry-validation  parity-check
phase_5: verification-contract  seeded-defect-case
```

The two phase-5 callers are written now and call reusable jobs that do not exist until `L2-T138`. That is deliberate and is not a bug: the template is consumed at product creation, which happens after BT-3, and §98.2 (L9006–9090) requires the context to be published before a repository's branch protection can list it. Do not defer them and do not guard them with an `if:`.



**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT" ] || { echo "ERROR: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"

# Create templates/workflows/ci.yml — the per-product caller.
# RULES:
#   - 11 jobs exactly, named as required-checks.yaml spells them
#   - Every uses: of the control plane is {{CONTROL_PLANE_REPO}}/.../ci.yml@{{WORKFLOWS_TAG}}
#   - PINNED TAG — never @main, never a branch ref
#   - No if:, no path filters
#   - Phase-5 callers (verification-contract, seeded-defect-case) are written now
#     even though the reusable jobs don't exist until L2-T138 — this is deliberate.

3. Zero `if:` keys, zero path filters.
4. `check_required_contexts` reports every phase-4 and phase-5 context emitted.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
python -m tools.evidence.check_required_contexts --templates templates/workflows --registry templates/workflows/required-checks.yaml --summary; echo "EXIT=$?"
echo "JOBS=$(grep -cE '^  (unit-tests|integration-tests|build|security-scan|licence-scan|slopsquat-check|contract-validation|registry-validation|parity-check|verification-contract|seeded-defect-case):' templates/workflows/ci.yml)"
echo "BRANCH_REFS=$(grep -cE 'uses:.*@(main|master|refs/heads/)' templates/workflows/ci.yml)"
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT** (`checked=15` is the registry's full context count. The nine phase-4 and two phase-5 contexts are now emitted by this template; the two `always` contexts resolve against `.github/workflows/` per `L2-T534` and are already emitted by `L2-T004` and `L2-T110`; the two phase-6 contexts are not emitted yet.)

```
FAIL check_required_contexts checked=15 failed=2
EXIT=2
JOBS=11
BRANCH_REFS=0
```

**STOP** — the `FAIL` above is expected and is **not** a blocker: the two remaining contexts, `artifact-digest-recorded` and `sbom-emitted`, arrive at `L2-T302`. Record the number and move on. File a blocker only if `failed=` is still non-zero after `L2-T302`, title `BLOCKER L2-T301: required contexts still unemitted after the build template`.

**CLOSE:** §0.3 close block, `<branch-slug>` = `t301-template-ci`.

## 4. Task detail — Phase BT-2, execution order 31–38

BT-2 opens only when L0 declares the S1 sync point passed (`master/04-phase-map.md` §4). Everything in this phase serves one sentence: *"The production artifact is the same digest verified in staging. Never rebuilt"* (§101 invariant 22, L9483).

### L2-T538 — SBOM-beside-digest assertion

> **Index — `L2-T508` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T508` in full (*Implement `tools/evidence/build-deployment-record.sh`*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T538`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 31 · **Phase** BT-2 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T530 · **Branch slug** `t538-sbom-assert`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/sbom_assert.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/sbom/**`
**Spec:** §48.3 L4317–4320 — *"Every production artifact build emits a Software Bill of Materials beside the artifact digest — same pipeline step, same storage discipline, same immutability"*; §33.2 L2854–2869

**Build this.** A tool that reads a build manifest and fails unless, for every recorded artifact digest, an SBOM is recorded **in the same manifest entry**: same step id, same storage location prefix, and an immutability marker. `checked=` counts digests; `failed=` counts digests with no conforming SBOM. Tool-id `sbom_assert`.

Fixtures under `fixtures/sbom/`: `good.json` (2 digests, 2 SBOMs, same step, same prefix), `missing.json` (2 digests, 1 SBOM), `later-step.json` (2 digests, 2 SBOMs, one emitted in a different step — a failure, because §48.3 says *same pipeline step*).

3. `later-step.json` → `FAIL sbom_assert checked=2 failed=1`, exit `2`.
4. A manifest with zero digests → `ERROR sbom_assert checked=0 failed=0`, exit `3`. A build that produced no artifact is not a passing build.

**SELF-VERIFY**

### L2-T120 — `build.yml` — immutable artifact, digest, SBOM

**#** 32 · **Phase** BT-2 · **Size** L · **Deps** L2-T538, L2-T532 · **Branch slug** `t120-build`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/build.yml`
**Spec:** §33.4 L2887–2912 (*"Immutable artifact (digest recorded)"*, *"Artifact immutability is P0"*); §48.3 L4317–4320; §101 invariants 22 and 23, L9483–9484

**Build this.** The single reusable build. It builds once, records the digest, and emits the SBOM **in the same step**. It emits two required contexts by job name: `artifact-digest-recorded` and `sbom-emitted`. It runs `sbom_assert` over its own build manifest before reporting success. It contains **no rebuild path**: no retry that rebuilds, no fallback that rebuilds when the registry is unreachable (invariant 23, L9484). A registry that cannot be reached is a failure, printed with the literal string `REGISTRY_UNREACHABLE_NO_REBUILD`, never a rebuild.

See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**Build this.** A tool that answers one question: may a production deploy start at this instant for this product? It resolves the instant in the **product's declared operating timezone**, never the runner's, and applies both halves of the §34.2 boundary — the 15:00 Friday start bound **and** the observation-window-within-core-hours bound. It fails closed: an absent or unparseable timezone, or an absent core-hours declaration, is `ERROR` and exit `3`. Progressive-delivery deploys and deploys carrying a §47 out-of-hours authorisation are excepted, and the exception is an explicit input, never inferred.

Tool-id `timegate`. `checked=` counts the boundary conditions evaluated (always 2); `failed=` counts those breached.

**Build this.** The gate itself. Given an actor login, a required capability and a `people.yaml`, it passes only when **all** hold: the login exists in `people.yaml`; the person is a human identity, not a machine account; the person holds the named capability. Anything else fails, including an unreadable `people.yaml`, which is `ERROR` and exit `3` — *"there is no 'assume pass' branch anywhere in Lane 2"* (§0.4).

It also implements the machine layer's **positive dispatch allowlist**: the machine account's permitted dispatch set is *"the digest generators of Section 94.7 and nothing else"* (§37.3). Anything else dispatched by a machine identity fails with the literal string `MACHINE_ACTOR_REJECTED`.

Tool-id `actor_gate`. `checked=` counts the three conditions (always 3); `failed=` counts those not met.

Fixtures under `fixtures/actor/`: `people.yaml` with one human holding `devops`, one human holding nothing, one machine account; plus the actor names `dev-1`, `dev-2`, `machine-1`.

**Build this.** The mechanism of record. Given a recorded approval artifact and the deploying identity, it passes only when the approving identity is present, resolvable, and different from the deploying identity. **If it cannot tell — the approval record is absent, the approver field is empty, or the identity does not resolve — it fails**, exit `3`, and never `0`. On the equality case it emits the exact string `APPROVER_EQUALS_DEPLOYER` (`L2-00-charter.md` §7 DoD-04 asserts this literal).

Tool-id `identity_gate`. `checked=` is always 1 — the one comparison; `failed=` is 0 or 1.

**Build this.** The load-bearing comparison of the lane. Given a requested digest and a staging verification record, it passes only when the two digests are byte-identical. One sanctioned equivalence exists and is implemented explicitly: for an **S18 platform-rebuild** deployment (§32, D78), the recorded identity — pinned commit, lockfile and build configuration — stands in for the digest throughout the chain. That substitution is taken from the record, never inferred, and a record claiming platform-rebuild equivalence without all three components fails.

Tool-id `digest_invariant`. `checked=1`, `failed=` 0 or 1.

**Files:** `tools/evidence/records_client.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/records/**`
**Spec:** §97.2 L8843–8926 — *"the deployment-record and event writes are required, failing steps of `deploy-production.yml` rather than trailing best-effort ones"*; §40.1 L3644–3686 (the records-writer credential); §101 invariant 48 (records are never edited in place)

**Build this.** The one client every Lane 2 workflow uses to write a record. It validates the payload against the record schema published by Lane 4 (`schemas/records/**` — read only, never written), writes exactly one new file under the store path, and **refuses to modify an existing file**. It obtains its credential through the records-writer path declared under D-L2-03 and never through a literal token. `--dry-run` validates and prints without writing.

Lane 2 owns the **call**; Lane 4 owns the schema, the store and the writer semantics (`PARTITION.md` line 20). This module is a client, not a second writer.

Tool-id `records_client`. `checked=` counts payload fields validated; `failed=` counts validation failures.

L2-T544  Records-write client
§97.2 L8843-8926 — the deployment-record and event writes are required,
failing steps of deploy-production.yml rather than trailing best-effort ones.
§40.1 L3644-3686 — records-writer credential obtained through declared path.
§101 invariant 48 — records are never edited in place.

Lane 2 owns the call; Lane 4 owns the schema, the store, and the writer
semantics (PARTITION.md line 20). This module is a client, not a second writer.

No literal credential appears in this module. Credential obtained through
the path declared under D-L2-03 in contracts/workflow-io/records-writer.yaml.

### L2-T545 — Event writer: one file per event, bound envelope

> **Index — `L2-T515` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T515` in full (*Append-only and effective-dating assertion*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T545`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 40 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T544, **D-L2-03** · **Branch slug** `t545-event-writer`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/event_writer.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/events/**`
**Spec:** §97.3 L8929–8953 — one file per event under a date partition, the nine required envelope fields, `event_type` constrained to an identifier and never free text; `PARTITION.md` rule 3 (no shared mutable file, ever)

**Build this.** The event half of the write path. It writes exactly one file per event — never an append to a shared period file — and rejects, **at write time and before any file is created**, an event missing any envelope field or carrying an `event_type` absent from Lane 4's published taxonomy. Lane 2 supplies the event; Lane 4 owns the enum.

Tool-id `event_writer`. `checked=` counts envelope fields validated (9); `failed=` counts violations.

Fixtures under `fixtures/events/`: `production_deployed.yaml` (valid), `no-actor.yaml` (one field missing), `free-text-type.yaml` (an `event_type` not in the taxonomy).

### L2-T130 — `deploy-staging.yml`

**#** 41 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** L · **Deps** L2-T541, L2-T545, L2-T120 · **Branch slug** `t130-deploy-staging`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`
**Spec:** §37.3 L3261–3268 (actor gate is the **first step**); §33.4 L2887–2912 (staging deploy → smoke → UAT); §97.2 L8843–8926 (record and event writes are required, failing steps)

**Build this.** The first of the five privileged workflows. Step order is fixed and is asserted mechanically by `L2-T554`:

1. **actor gate** — `actor_gate` with capability `devops`. First step. Nothing before it, not even a checkout.
2. deploy the artifact digest built by `build.yml`; never rebuild.
3. smoke tests.
4. write the staging deployment record via `records_client` — a **required, failing** step.
5. append the staging event via `event_writer` — a **required, failing** step.

The workflow declares `environment: staging` and least-privilege permissions.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The first step of the deploy job invokes `tools.evidence.actor_gate`; no step precedes it.
2. The record and event steps carry no `continue-on-error` and are not conditioned on earlier success being optional.
3. No build or rebuild command appears in the file.
4. `lint_workflow` is clean.

**Build this.** The workflow all six rules of §0.6 converge on. Fixed step order:

1. **actor gate** — `actor_gate` with capability `production-approval`. First step.
2. **workflow-identity gate** — `identity_gate`; fails closed on `APPROVER_EQUALS_DEPLOYER` and on any inability to tell.
3. **digest invariant** — `digest_invariant` comparing the requested digest with the staging-verified record.
4. **time gate** — `timegate`, resolved in the product's declared timezone.
5. deploy the **same digest**. No build step exists in this file.
6. smoke tests, then health checks.
7. deployment record via `records_client` — required, failing.
8. production event via `event_writer` — required, failing.

`environment: production`. Least-privilege permissions. No `continue-on-error` anywhere.

3. Record and event steps are required and failing — zero `continue-on-error` in the file.
4. A negative run where the requested digest differs from the staging-verified digest exits non-zero **and writes no deployment record** (charter DoD-03; exercised by `L2-T572` in `L2-03-production-gates.md` and re-asserted here).

### L2-T132 — `migrate.yml` — cases A–G

**#** 43 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** L · **Deps** L2-T541, L2-T545 · **Branch slug** `t132-migrate`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/migrate.yml`
**Spec:** §34.3 L2936–2944 (CI-only application, ordered and versioned, destructive migrations need `migration-review` plus QA sign-off, verified backup first); §34.4 L2945–2956 (the seven cases)

**Build this.** The migration workflow, with the seven §34.4 cases encoded as explicit branches, each emitting its case letter and taking its declared action:

| Case | Encoded behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| A | migration and deployment succeed → proceed to smoke and health; deployment record |
| B | migration succeeds, app deploy fails → automated rollback of the application to the previous digest; schema stays forward; incident plus deployment record |
| C | migration fails partway → halt; application deployment does not start; no automatic repair |
| D | irreversible by nature → requires the `non-reversible` declaration, `migration-review` capability, QA approval and a verified backup immediately prior; **never claims automatic schema rollback** |
| E | app rollback needs a schema that no longer exists → treated as hotfix, not rollback; incident plus plan-quality review |
| F | database restoration required → forensic snapshot **first**, then the per-product production-restore workflow; never hand-run credentials |
| G | long-running migration exceeds its window → record the overrun; stop only if resumable and consistent |

Step 0 is the actor gate with capability `devops`; a destructive migration additionally requires `migration-review`.

# Expected:
# OK lint_workflow checked=1 failed=0 / EXIT=0
# CASES=7 / FIRST_STEP=1 / BACKUP_ASSERT=1
```

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The actor gate is step 0.
2. All seven case letters appear as explicit branches, each emitting the literal string `MIGRATION_CASE_<A..G>`.
3. Case D contains no automatic schema-rollback path.
4. Case F invokes the production-restore workflow and contains no inline credential.
5. A destructive migration path asserts a verified backup before applying.
6. `lint_workflow` is clean.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
python -m tools.evidence.lint_workflow --path .github/workflows/migrate.yml --summary; echo "EXIT=$?"
echo "CASES=$(grep -cE 'MIGRATION_CASE_[A-G]' .github/workflows/migrate.yml)"

echo "BACKUP_ASSERT=$(grep -c 'VERIFIED_BACKUP_REQUIRED' .github/workflows/migrate.yml)"
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```
OK lint_workflow checked=1 failed=0
EXIT=0
CASES=7
FIRST_STEP=1
BACKUP_ASSERT=1
```

**STOP** — case C's repair step is *"the documented repair step"* per product; it is not something this workflow invents. If no per-product repair step is declared, halt is the correct behaviour and the run fails. Rule S4; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T132: case C requires a per-product repair step that is undeclared`.

**CLOSE:** §0.3 close block, `<branch-slug>` = `t132-migrate`.

### L2-T133 — The rollback workflow

> **VERIFICATION ONLY:** Verifies the rollback.yml created by L2-T176.

**#** 44 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T131, **D-L2-05** · **Branch slug** `t133-rollback`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/rollback.yml`
**Spec:** §27.2 L2567–2576 (the rollback exemption and its exact boundary); §37.3 L3261–3268 (the actor gate is the one check the exemption does not lift); §101 invariant 27, L9488

**Build this.** The dedicated rollback workflow. It redeploys a digest that **already carries a production-approval record**, and is therefore exempt from the workflow-identity production-approval gate — and from nothing else. Specifically:

* The **actor gate stays**, and requires `incident-response` or `production-approval` from a **human** identity. *"An exemption from the identity gate that also admitted machine dispatch would let a background-layer credential return production to an older digest across a migration boundary"* (§27.2).
* It **defaults to the previous approved-and-deployed digest** and displays it with its deploy date and whether a migration boundary lies between it and the current digest.
* It requires only confirmation to run.
* Each run writes an **exceptional-authorisation record** (§26.3, §42.3).
* The digest invariant still applies: the digest being restored must be one that passed staging verification.

### L2-T134 — `restore-test.yml` — one workflow, two targets

**#** 45 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** L · **Deps** L2-T541, L2-T545 · **Branch slug** `t134-restore-test`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/restore-test.yml`
**Spec:** §44.5 L4016–4021 — *"It takes its restore target as a parameter, and the monthly restore rotation invokes this same workflow with the declared `restore_environment` as that target — one workflow, two targets — so the first production execution is never the first execution"*; §44.3 L4003–4011 (the integrity check is asserted machine-side)

**Build this.** One reusable engine, parameterised by restore target. It runs the **forensic-snapshot stage first** and blocks the restore stage until the capture reports success (§44.5, §34.4 case F step 0). It executes the declared `integrity_check` **machine-side** — row counts and checksums computed by the job — and records the result together with a **named verifier**. A restore whose record names no integrity-check result and no verifier is Red drift, so the record write is a required, failing step.

Step 0 is the actor gate with capability `devops`.

# Expected:

```

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Actor gate is step 0.
2. The restore target is an input, not a constant; the file contains exactly one restore implementation.
3. The forensic-snapshot stage precedes the restore stage and gates it.
4. The integrity check is computed by the job; the file contains no path in which a human types the result.
5. The record write carrying `integrity_check` and `verifier` is required and failing.
6. `lint_workflow` is clean.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
python -m tools.evidence.lint_workflow --path .github/workflows/restore-test.yml --summary; echo "EXIT=$?"
echo "TARGET_INPUT=$(grep -c 'restore_target:' .github/workflows/restore-test.yml)"

echo "INTEGRITY=$(grep -c 'INTEGRITY_CHECK_RESULT' .github/workflows/restore-test.yml)"
echo "VERIFIER=$(grep -c 'NAMED_VERIFIER' .github/workflows/restore-test.yml)"
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```
OK lint_workflow checked=1 failed=0
EXIT=0
TARGET_INPUT=1
SNAPSHOT_FIRST=1
INTEGRITY=1
VERIFIER=1
```

**STOP** — do not write a second, separate production-restore engine. §44.5 is explicit that it is one workflow with two targets, *so the first production execution is never the first execution*. Rule S4; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T134: asked for a separate production-restore engine`.

**CLOSE:** §0.3 close block, `<branch-slug>` = `t134-restore-test`.

### L2-T136 — `org-export.yml`

**#** 46 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** L · **Deps** L2-T532, L2-T545 · **Branch slug** `t136-org-export`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/org-export.yml`
**Spec:** §45.3 L4064–4077 — the migrations REST API for repositories, issues, pull requests and review records; a **separate GraphQL dump** for Projects v2 boards, which *"are not included in migration archives"*; an append-only, write-only credential to object-locked, versioned storage; encryption with a key held outside GitHub

**Build this.** The scheduled organisation export. Two distinct capture legs, because §45.3 requires each metadata class to travel by the mechanism it actually supports (D80):

1. **migrations REST API** — repositories, issues, pull requests, review records.
2. **Projects v2 GraphQL dump** — a separate leg, never assumed present in the migration archive.

The export is encrypted with a key held outside GitHub, written with an **append-only, write-only** credential that cannot read, overwrite or delete what previous runs wrote, and lands in a different provider and credential domain. The audit-log gap on the Team plan is a recorded accepted risk, not a leg this workflow invents. Export failure raises SIG-34 and writes an event.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Exactly two capture legs, and the Projects leg uses GraphQL, not the migrations API.
2. The workflow contains no read or delete call against the export storage.
3. Encryption is applied in the workflow; the key is referenced as a secret, never inlined.
4. A failed export writes an event and fails the run.
5. `lint_workflow` is clean.

**SELF-VERIFY**

set -euo pipefail

echo "INLINE_KEY=$(grep -cE 'BEGIN (RSA |EC |OPENSSH )?PRIVATE KEY' .github/workflows/org-export.yml)"
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```
OK lint_workflow checked=1 failed=0
EXIT=0
LEGS=2
READ_OR_DELETE=0
INLINE_KEY=0
```

**STOP** — if the independent-provider storage, its object-lock configuration or the encryption key's custody are not provisioned, that is `infra/**` and `assets/**` — Lane 5's trees.

### L2-T137 — `background-queue.yml`

**#** 47 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T541 · **Branch slug** `t137-background-queue`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/background-queue.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 (*"and conditionally `background-queue.yml`"*); §37.3 L3261–3268 (the background layer merges nothing, approves nothing, deploys nothing, and holds no production credential); §101 invariant 18, L9477

**Build this.** The conditional per-product background-work workflow. Its defining property is what it cannot do: it holds no production credential, reaches no production database, and cannot merge, approve or deploy. The actor gate is step 0 and the machine account's **positive dispatch allowlist** applies — the digest generators of §94.7 and nothing else. Anything else dispatched by a machine identity fails with `MACHINE_ACTOR_REJECTED`.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Actor gate is step 0 and enforces the positive allowlist.
2. The workflow declares no `environment: production` and references no production secret.
3. It contains no merge, approve or deploy call (`gh pr merge`, `gh pr review`, any deploy invocation).
4. `lint_workflow` is clean.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
python -m tools.evidence.lint_workflow --path .github/workflows/background-queue.yml --summary; echo "EXIT=$?"

echo "PRIVILEGED_CALLS=$(grep -cE 'gh pr (merge|review)' .github/workflows/background-queue.yml)"

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```
OK lint_workflow checked=1 failed=0
EXIT=0
FIRST_STEP=1
PROD_ENV=0
PRIVILEGED_CALLS=0
```

**STOP** — if a background task appears to need production access, the answer is no; §37.3 is *"prohibited by architecture, not by policy"*. Rule S4; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T137: a background task is requesting production access`.

### L2-T546 — Verification-contract check

> **Index — `L2-T516` is not defined here.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 defines `L2-T516` in full (*Phase-4 roll-up, self-verify sweep and lane PR*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T546`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 48 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T530 · **Branch slug** `t546-verification-contract`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/verification_contract_check.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/vc/**`
**Spec:** §31 L2741–2802 — presence, coverage map, at least one seeded-defect case; §31.3 — *"For products whose `classification.reliability_criticality` is `high` or `critical`, the performance mechanism is required: `contract.yaml` must declare it, and the verification-contract check in CI fails if it is absent"*

**Build this.** The check behind the `verification-contract` context. It fails on any of four conditions: `verification/contract.yaml` absent; no coverage map; no seeded-defect case declared; the product's `reliability_criticality` is `high` or `critical` and no performance mechanism is declared. `checked=4`, `failed=` the number breached. Tool-id `verification_contract_check`.

### L2-T517 — Seeded-defect execution and SIG-18

**Build this.** The inversion. The tool reads the seeded case's result and **fails when the seeded case passed**, because a passing seeded case proves the contract stopped discriminating. It raises SIG-18 on that condition with the literal string `SIG-18`. A run with no seeded case at all is `ERROR`, exit `3` — the absence is not a pass.

Tool-id `seeded_defect`. `checked=` counts seeded cases; `failed=` counts those that passed.

### L2-T138 — `ci.yml`: `verification-contract`, `seeded-defect-case`

**#** 50 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T517 · **Branch slug** `t138-ci-verification`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (edit — one of the five permitted edits, §0.1)
**Spec:** §31.2 L2741–2802 (execution cadence: on every default-branch run); §98.2 L9006–9090 (the verification contract arrives at Phase 5)

**Build this.** Two jobs, named exactly `verification-contract` and `seeded-defect-case`, invoking `verification_contract_check` and `seeded_defect`. Neither carries an `if:` — including no `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`. The cadence *"on every default-branch run"* is calibrated configuration and is expressed as an **input the caller supplies**, evaluated inside the job, so the context is still emitted on every run and reports an explicit success when the cadence says no run was due.

The two phase-5 **caller** jobs already exist in `templates/workflows/ci.yml` from `L2-T301`; this task supplies the reusable jobs they call, and `check_required_contexts` must still report `failed=0` afterwards.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Jobs named exactly `verification-contract` and `seeded-defect-case` exist in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
2. Neither carries an `if:`; the cadence is evaluated inside the job.
3. `check_required_contexts` still reports `OK … checked=15 failed=0`.

### L2-T518 — Conformance-profile evidence substitution

**Files:** `tools/evidence/profile_evidence.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/profile/**`
**Spec:** §15.7 L1587–1606 (the seven profiles and their equivalent evidence); §32 L2803–2828 — *"Items 10 and 11 are the evidence of the service conformance profile. A product declaring a different profile substitutes its equivalent evidence for them"*

**Build this.** The substitution table, in code, for evidence-chain items 10 and 11. Exactly seven profiles, transcribed from the §15.7 table and no others:

| Profile | Substitutes for items 10 and 11 |
| --- | --- |
| `service` | the contract as written — health and version endpoints |
| `client-app` | crash-free-session telemetry and store version adoption |
| `library` | registry version plus consumer contract tests |
| `batch` | job success and data-freshness signals |
| `customer-hosted` | customer-attested deploy and restore records, or a recorded exemption with a compensating control |
| `white-label` | a per-deployment environment list |
| `static-site` | build reproducibility |

An undeclared profile defaults to `service` (§15.7: *"`service` by default"*). An unknown profile string is `ERROR`, exit `3` — never a silent fallback to `service`, because *"a `service` product cannot escape availability evidence by mis-declaring its profile"*.

### L2-T519 — Evidence chain — the eleven questions

**#** 52 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** L · **Deps** L2-T518, L2-T544 · **Branch slug** `t519-evidence-chain`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/evidence_chain.py`, `tools/evidence/fixtures/chain/**`
**Spec:** §32 L2803–2828 — the eleven questions and their sources; *"item 5 and item 11 must match"*; §98.2 Phase 6 completion check (*"the eleven-item evidence chain answerable for one real deployment"*); charter DoD-14

**Build this.** The reason subsystem F exists. Given one deployment record, the tool answers all eleven questions of §32 and fails if **any** answer is empty. The eleven, transcribed in order:

| # | Question | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Which git commit? | artifact label and deployment record |
| 2 | Which pull request? | commit-to-PR association |
| 3 | Who approved it at Gate 2, and in which role? | PR review record cross-referenced with the assignment registry |
| 4 | Which CI run produced it? | workflow run linked to the commit |
| 5 | What is the artifact digest? | registry digest, recorded at build |
| 6 | When was it deployed to staging? | staging deployment record |
| 7 | Did staging verification pass? | smoke result and UAT record in the workflow run |
| 8 | Who approved production? | production-approval record, verified by the workflow-identity gate |
| 9 | When was it deployed to production? | production deployment record |
| 10 | Did post-deployment smoke pass? | smoke result attached to the deployment |
| 11 | What digest is running right now? | `GET /version` on the live service |

Items 10 and 11 route through `profile_evidence` for a non-`service` profile. The tool additionally asserts the §32 invariant: **item 5 and item 11 match**, and where the record declares an S18 platform-rebuild deployment the recorded identity stands in for the digest throughout.

Tool-id `evidence_chain`. `checked=11`; `failed=` counts unanswered questions plus the 5-vs-11 mismatch.

Fixtures under `fixtures/chain/`: `dep-complete.yaml` (all eleven answered, 5 == 11), `dep-no-approver.yaml` (item 8 empty), `dep-digest-drift.yaml` (5 != 11), `dep-client-app.yaml` (profile substitution on 10 and 11).

### L2-T139 — `verify-digest-chain.yml` — sweep and recovery gate

**#** 54 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T550 · **Branch slug** `t139-wf-verify-digest-chain`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/verify-digest-chain.yml`
**Spec:** §46.1 L4090–4131 (the six recovery steps, their owner and their clock — the escalation role, within the first half working day after recovery)

**Build this.** Two triggers on one workflow: a `schedule` for the routine sweep, and a `workflow_dispatch` for the recovery-step-3 run. It invokes `verify_digest_chain` over the estate and, on failure, writes an event and fails the run. It emits no required status context — it is an estate sweep, not a per-pull-request check, and it appears in no group of `required-checks.yaml`.



**Commands**

**Build this.** The observer that answers evidence-chain question 11. It reads a `/version` observation and compares the reported digest with the approved digest. A mismatch is a failure and prints the literal string `P0_DIGEST_MISMATCH`. A product whose declared `conformance_profile` does not expose the service interface routes to `profile_evidence` instead and is never failed for lacking an endpoint its shape cannot serve (§41.2, §15.7).

An unreachable endpoint is `ERROR`, exit `3` — unreachable is not matching.

**Build this.** Deterministic date arithmetic, and nothing else. Given the estate and an `--as-of` date, it computes each product's restore deadline from its applicable window and its **derived** `restore_tested` date — the newest passing record in `records/restore-tests/` — and proposes the coming month's subset. `classification.reliability_criticality` may only **tighten** the window: `critical` is 30 days, everything else is the 90-day floor. A declared `restore_tested` date that disagrees with the derived one is drift and fails: *"A hand-edited date is drift, not evidence."*

Tool-id `restore_rotation`. `checked=` counts products; `failed=` counts products past their window plus products whose declared date disagrees with the derived one.

Fixtures under `fixtures/rotation/`: `estate.yaml` with 4 products — one `critical` inside 30 days, one `critical` at 31 days, one standard at 89 days, one standard whose declared date is newer than its newest passing record.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. `--as-of 2026-08-27` on `estate.yaml` → `FAIL restore_rotation checked=4 failed=2`, exit `2` — the 31-day `critical` and the hand-edited date.
2. A `critical` product at 31 days fails; the same product at 29 days passes. The tightening is exercised in both directions.
3. The tool never widens a window: no code path produces a deadline beyond 90 days.
4. Output is identical for the same `--as-of` regardless of the runner's clock or timezone.

**Spec:** §34.1 L2915–2929 — *"A change is shipped only when all of the following are true"*, and *"Merged and deployed are tracked as separate metrics"*

**Build this.** The eight conditions, transcribed exactly and in order, with no ninth and no eighth dropped:

1. Pull request merged
2. Artifact built and digest recorded
3. Deployed to the target environment
4. Deployment reported success
5. Smoke tests passed
6. Production version recorded and matching the intended digest
7. Health checks green
8. `STATE.md` updated

Tool-id `shipped_assert`. `checked=8`; `failed=` counts unmet conditions. Merged and deployed are emitted as **separate** fields, never collapsed into one.

Fixtures under `fixtures/shipped/`: `complete.yaml` (all eight), `merged-only.yaml` (condition 1 only), `no-state-md.yaml` (seven of eight).

### L2-T143 — `canary-exercise.yml`

**#** 61 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T120, L2-T130 · **Branch slug** `t143-canary-exercise`
**Files:** `.github/workflows/canary-exercise.yml`
**Spec:** §61.3 L5215–5286 — *"A canary must be exercised, not merely observed. During its observation window, every canary product runs a synthetic exercise: a `workflow_dispatch` run of `ci.yml` and `build.yml`, and a staging deploy, each recorded on the change manifest"*; §101 invariants 71 and 72, L9548–9549

**Build this.** The synthetic exercise, exactly the three legs §61.3 names and no fourth:

1. `workflow_dispatch` run of `ci.yml`;
2. `workflow_dispatch` run of `build.yml`;
3. a staging deploy.

Each leg's result is recorded on the change manifest. A canary product with no activity in the window has **verified nothing**, so a run in which a leg did not execute fails with the literal string `UNEXERCISED_CANARY`. The `affected:` generator that selects the canary set is **not** built here — it is D-L2-01 and no lane owns `tools/fleet/**`.

3. Each leg writes its result to the change manifest reference supplied as an input.
4. No `affected:` generation logic appears in the file.
5. `lint_workflow` is clean.

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```

### L2-T554 — Actor-gate-is-step-0 assertion

> **Index — `L2-T524` is not defined here.** `L2-02-digest-invariant.md` §3 defines `L2-T524` in full (*Artifact publication check, and the never-rebuild rule*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T554`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 62 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T131, L2-T132, L2-T133, L2-T134 · **Branch slug** `t554-actor-gate-first`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/assert_actor_gate_first.py`
**Spec:** §37.3 L3261–3268 — the actor gate is *"the first step of every privileged workflow"*: `deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`, `migrate.yml`, the rollback workflow and the production-restore workflow; charter DoD-05; §101 invariant 18, L9477

**Build this.** The posture assertion. It parses every workflow under a given path, identifies the five privileged workflows by name, and asserts that **step index 0** of the workflow's entry job invokes the actor gate. It fails when a privileged workflow is missing, when the gate is not at index 0, or when a privileged workflow cannot be parsed.

The five, in the control-plane tree, are `deploy-staging.yml` (`L2-T130`), `deploy-production.yml` (`L2-T131`), `migrate.yml` (`L2-T132`), the rollback workflow (`L2-T133`) and `restore-test.yml` (`L2-T134`) — which **is** the production-restore workflow of §44.5, one engine with two targets, so there is no sixth file to look for.

The rollback workflow's filename is **D-L2-05's answer**; the tool reads that name from `templates/workflows/MANIFEST.yaml` once `L2-T311` lands, and until then from an explicit `--rollback-workflow` argument. It never guesses the name.

Tool-id `assert_actor_gate_first`. `checked=5`; `failed=` counts workflows failing the assertion.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. All five privileged workflows present with the gate at step 0 → `OK assert_actor_gate_first checked=5 failed=0`, exit `0`.
2. Moving the gate to step 1 in any one of them → `FAIL … checked=5 failed=1`, exit `2`. Exercised, not asserted.
3. A missing privileged workflow → `FAIL … checked=5 failed=1`, exit `2`.
4. An unnamed rollback workflow → `ERROR … checked=0 failed=0`, exit `3`.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```

**STOP** — if a privileged workflow needs a checkout, a login or a toolchain setup before the gate, the answer is no. §37.3 says first step, and *"Removing an actor gate is a workflow-file change and is therefore already Blocking drift"*.

### L2-T303 — `templates/workflows/deploy-staging.template.yml`

> # UPDATED PER FD-127 (2026-10-21)
> The already-built `templates/workflows/deploy-staging.template.yml` (following the L2-03/production-gate-chain pattern) is authoritative over this task doc. This task doc is corrected to match the live file.

**#** 63 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L2-T130, L2-T539 · **Branch slug** `t303-template-deploy-staging`
**Files:** `templates/workflows/deploy-staging.template.yml`
**Spec:** §33.2 L2854–2869 (required workflows per repository, generated from templates); §33.3 L2870–2886 (pinned-tag consumption); §33.4 L2887–2912 (environment deployment branch and tag policy)

**Build this.** The per-product caller for staging deployment. It calls `lumiverse-org/control-plane/.github/workflows/production-gate-chain.yml@workflows/v1` and declares `environment: staging`. It passes `{{PRODUCT_SLUG}}`, `{{TARGET_REPO}}`, `{{RUNNER_LABEL}}` and `{{SELF_HOSTED}}` through as inputs. It emits no required status context — deployment is not a pull-request check — and appears in no group of `required-checks.yaml`. No token appears inside a `${{ }}` expression. Trigger is `workflow_dispatch` only (D87).

**Commands**

The file `templates/workflows/deploy-staging.template.yml` is already committed on disk and authoritative per FD-127.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Calls `production-gate-chain.yml@workflows/v1`.
2. `environment: staging` declared.
3. No placeholder token sits inside a `${{ }}` expression.
4. `render_template --lint templates/workflows` is clean.

```

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```
OK render_template checked=12 failed=0

**STOP** — do not copy the gate logic into the template. The template is a caller; the gates live in the reusable workflow so a product cannot delete them on a branch (§33.4). Rule S4; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T303: asked to inline gate logic into a per-product template`.

**Spec:** §33.4 L2887–2912; §27.2 L2567–2576; D87 (line 10180)

**Build this.** The per-product caller for production deployment. It calls `lumiverse-org/control-plane/.github/workflows/production-gate-chain.yml@workflows/v1`, declares `environment: production`, and uses `workflow_dispatch` only (D87). The four gates stay in the reusable workflow; the template neither reimplements nor bypasses them.

**Commands**

The file `templates/workflows/deploy-production.template.yml` is already committed on disk and authoritative per FD-125 and FD-126.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Calls `production-gate-chain.yml@workflows/v1`.
2. `environment: production` declared.
3. Trigger is `workflow_dispatch` only (FD-126, D87); no push trigger.
4. No gate logic and no `if:` bypass appears in the file.
5. `render_template --lint templates/workflows` is clean.

**Spec:** §34.3 L2936–2944 — *"Migrations are ordered, versioned and applied through CI only. No human runs a migration by hand against production"*; §34.4 L2945–2956

**Build this.** The per-product caller for migrations, calling `{{CONTROL_PLANE_REPO}}/.github/workflows/migrate.yml@{{WORKFLOWS_TAG}}`. It contains no migration command of its own — the seven cases are the reusable workflow's, so a product cannot ship a variant of case D that promises a schema rollback that does not exist.



**Commands**

2. No `MIGRATION_CASE_` branch appears in the template — the cases live in the reusable workflow.
3. No inline database command appears in the template.
4. `render_template --lint` is clean.

**Spec:** §44.2 L3993–4002 (the rolling cadence); §44.5 L4016–4021 (one workflow, two targets)

**Build this.** The per-product caller for the monthly restore test. It calls the reusable restore engine with the product's declared `restore_environment` as the restore target. It hard-codes no target and no schedule of its own — the rotation is computed by `restore-rotation.yml`, never remembered in a template.

**Build this.** The second target of the same engine. It calls the reusable restore workflow with **production** as the restore target, runs the forensic-snapshot stage first, and writes an **exceptional-authorisation record** — who authorised, why, which backup, which target — as a required, failing step. It carries the declared `integrity_check` result and a **named verifier**; a run whose record names neither is Red drift (§44.5), so the record write asserts both fields before it writes.

**No credential is handed to or typed by a human**: access is granted through the workflow's scoped identity for the run (AT-103, L9352). The template contains no credential field, no prompt for one, and no manual step that would require one.

**Build this.** The conditional per-product caller. "Conditionally" means the template is **rendered only for products that declare background work** — a `create-product` decision, Lane 3's — never an `if:` inside the workflow.

**Spec:** §27.2 L2567–2576; §37.3 L3261–3268; §101 invariant 27, L9488

**Build this.** The per-product caller for rollback, built as `templates/workflows/rollback.template.yml` per L2-T370. It calls the reusable rollback workflow at `{{WORKFLOWS_TAG}}`, defaults to the previous approved-and-deployed digest, and requires only confirmation from a human identity holding `incident-response` or `production-approval`. It contains no approval gate of its own — the exemption is §27.2's and lives in the reusable workflow, where a product cannot widen it.

**Commands**

The file `templates/workflows/rollback.template.yml` is already committed on disk (authored under L2-T370 in `lanes/L2-03-production-gates.md`).

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The template's filename is `templates/workflows/rollback.template.yml` (per L2-T370).
2. Exactly one control-plane `uses:`, pinned to `rollback.yml@workflows/v1`.
3. No identity gate and no additional approval gate appears in the template.
4. `render_template --lint templates/workflows` is clean.

**Build this.** The manifest Lane 3's `create-product` reads. One row per template, each declaring: the template filename, the rendered destination filename, whether it is **always** rendered or **conditional**, and the condition where conditional. Exactly two conditions exist and both come from §33.2 and §15.5:

| Template | Rendered | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci.yml` | always | — |
| `build.yml` | always | — |
| `deploy-staging.yml` | always | — |
| `deploy-production.yml` | always | — |
| `migrate.yml` | always | — |
| `restore-test.yml` | always | — |
| `restore-production.yml` | conditional | the product declares a `recovery:` block |
| `background-queue.yml` | conditional | the product declares background work |
| `rollback.yml` | always | — |

The manifest also names the rollback workflow's filename once, so `assert_actor_gate_first` (`L2-T554`) stops needing its `--rollback-workflow` argument.

1. Exactly nine rows, one per template file in the tree; no template is unlisted and no row names a file that does not exist.
2. Exactly two rows are `conditional`, and their conditions are the two above.
3. The rollback filename appears exactly once and matches `L2-T309`'s basename.
4. `render_template --manifest` validates the file.

### L2-T144 — `control-plane-ci.yml`: `recovery:` ⇒ `restore-production.yml` and template drift

**Spec:** §15.5 L1564–1582 — *"A product with a `recovery:` block and no `restore-production.yml` workflow"* fails the build; §44.5 L4016–4021 (Blocking-class drift, §44.4 applies); §53.1 L4653–4689 (the template comparison)

**Build this.** Two steps added to the existing control-plane CI. First: for every product declaring a `recovery:` block, assert `restore-production.yml` exists in that product's repository; a missing one fails the build. Second: compare each product's rendered workflows against `templates/workflows/MANIFEST.yaml` and fail on drift — a template row with no rendered counterpart, or a rendered workflow the manifest does not list.

### L2-T700 — Execute AT-024 — a shared CI workflow breaks

**Build this.** The acceptance test, **executed**, not described. Four legs, each recorded as a line in `tools/evidence/at/results/at-024.txt`:

1. **impact analysis before rollout** — the `affected:` block exists on the change manifest before the canary set is selected. Lane 2 asserts its presence; it does **not** generate it (D-L2-01, `tools/fleet/**` is unowned).
2. **the canary catches it** — a deliberately broken reusable workflow is rolled to the canary set and `canary-exercise.yml` fails.
3. **platform rollback reverts the workflow tag** — the tag is reverted by `revert-reusable-workflow-tag` and the canary returns to green.
4. **unmigrated products are unaffected** — a product pinned to the previous tag runs green throughout, proving pinned-tag consumption.

**Build this.** The acceptance test, executed with the control plane simulated unreachable. Three legs recorded in `tools/evidence/at/results/at-029.txt`:

1. **products keep serving** — the running services are unaffected by control-plane unavailability; GitHub is the control plane, not a product runtime dependency (§46.1).
2. **the manual rollback path works** — a rollback to a locally cached digest executes using the pull-only registry credential on the production host, with nothing from GitHub.
3. **the path is documented and was followed** — the documented procedure is the one executed, and any step that had to be improvised is a failure of this leg.

### L2-T703 — Execute AT-103 — production restore, no hand-held credential

**#** 75 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** L · **Deps** L2-T307, L2-T134 · **Branch slug** `t703-at103`
**Files:** `tools/evidence/at/at-103.sh`
**Spec:** AT-103, L9352 — *"Every product declaring a `recovery:` block carries `restore-production.yml`, generated from the template, and the workflow executes end to end with an exceptional-authorisation record and without any credential being handed to or typed by a human"*; §44.5 L4016–4021; charter DoD-16

**Build this.** The acceptance test, executed. Four legs recorded in `tools/evidence/at/results/at-103.txt`:

1. **every `recovery:` product carries `restore-production.yml`**, generated from the template — asserted across the estate, not on one product.
2. **the workflow executes end to end**, forensic snapshot first, then restore.
3. **an exceptional-authorisation record is written** naming who authorised, why, which backup and which target, plus the `integrity_check` result and the named verifier.
4. **no credential is handed to or typed by a human** — access is granted through the workflow's scoped identity for the run, and the run, its authorisation and its result are recorded.

Tool-id `at-103`. `checked=4`; `failed=` counts legs that did not behave as AT-103 states.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. All four legs execute; leg 1 covers every product declaring `recovery:`.
2. Leg 3's record carries all six fields; a record missing the verifier or the integrity-check result is a failed leg (Red drift, §44.5).
3. Leg 4 is proved by the absence of any credential prompt in the run, not by assertion.
4. The whole run is recorded.

### L2-T555 — DoD acceptance matrix and lane handoff

> **Index — `L2-T525` is not defined here.** `L2-02-digest-invariant.md` §3 defines `L2-T525` in full (*SBOM beside the digest*) and is authoritative for that id; this block is different work and now carries the id `L2-T555`. See `L2-99-review.md` B2 and the §2.1 index.

**#** 76 · **Phase** BT-3 · **Size** M · **Deps** every task above · **Branch slug** `t555-handoff`

**Spec:** `L2-00-charter.md` §7 (DoD-01 … DoD-20); §98.2 L9006–9090 (the Phase 4, 5 and 6 completion checks Lane 2 is accountable for); `PARTITION.md` rule 4 (a lane's output is consumed through a published artifact)

**Build this.** Two artifacts, and the lane is closed.

`acceptance_matrix.py` runs every DoD row of the charter §7 as a command and prints one §0.4 line with tool-id `acceptance_matrix`: `checked=20`, `failed=` the number of DoD rows not proved. Every row is proved by executing its proof, never by reading a file and believing it. The twenty rows are mapped to tasks in §7 of this document.

`HANDOFF.md` states, for each consumer, exactly what Lane 2 published and where:

| Consumer | Published artifact | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lane 5 (branch protection) | the required-status-check context names | `templates/workflows/required-checks.yaml` |
| Lane 3 (`create-product`) | the workflow templates, their placeholders and their rendering conditions | `templates/workflows/MANIFEST.yaml`, `templates/workflows/PLACEHOLDERS.yaml` |
| Lane 3 (reconciler, §53.1) | the consumed reusable-workflow tag and its resolved commit SHA | the `publish-workflow-tag.yml` run output |

## What Lane 2 published and where — by consumer

| Consumer | Published artifact | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lane 5 (branch protection) | the required-status-check context names (15 contexts in 3 groups) | `templates/workflows/required-checks.yaml` |
| Lane 3 (`create-product`) | the workflow templates, their placeholders and their rendering conditions | `templates/workflows/MANIFEST.yaml`, `templates/workflows/PLACEHOLDERS.yaml` |
| Lane 3 (reconciler, §53.1) | the consumed reusable-workflow tag and its resolved commit SHA | the `publish-workflow-tag.yml` run output |
| Lane 4 (records) | the record and event kinds Lane 2 writes (deployment, uat, restore-test, eval, events/) | `tools/evidence/HANDOFF.md` (this file) |
| L0 | the eight open decisions and their current state | `L2-05-tasks.md` §1 |

---

## Record and event kinds written by Lane 2

| Kind | Writer | Schema owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deployment` | `tools/evidence/records_client.py` | Lane 4 (`schemas/records/**`) |
| `uat` | `tools/evidence/records_client.py` | Lane 4 |
| `restore-test` | `tools/evidence/records_client.py` | Lane 4 |
| `eval` | `tools/evidence/records_client.py` | Lane 4 |
| production_deployed event | `tools/evidence/event_writer.py` | Lane 4 |
| staging_deployed event | `tools/evidence/event_writer.py` | Lane 4 |

---

## Open decisions at handoff

See `L2-05-tasks.md` §1 for the full list. All eight are still open at the time this file is written. No decision in §1 was resolved by Lane 2; each is L0's to answer.

---

## DoD status

`acceptance_matrix.py` is the machine-readable gate. `checked=20 failed=0` is the only closing state.

```
python -m tools.evidence.acceptance_matrix --summary
```

Expected: `OK acceptance_matrix checked=20 failed=0`

---

## Owned paths (exclusive)

- `.github/workflows/**`
- `templates/workflows/**`
- `tools/evidence/**`

Lane 2 wrote no file outside these three trees. DoD-20 and the §0.3 close block on every task enforce this claim across the full cycle history.
EOF

git add tools/evidence/acceptance_matrix.py tools/evidence/HANDOFF.md
git commit -m "L2-T555: acceptance_matrix.py and HANDOFF.md — DoD matrix and lane handoff"
```

**Acceptance criteria**

1. `acceptance_matrix --summary` prints `OK acceptance_matrix checked=20 failed=0` and exits `0`.
2. Every DoD row is proved by executing a command; no row is proved by inspection.
3. `HANDOFF.md` names all five consumers and, for each, a path that exists.
4. `git status --porcelain` shows no file outside the three owned trees, on this branch and on every branch in the lane's history.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
python -m tools.evidence.acceptance_matrix --summary; echo "EXIT=$?"
echo "CONSUMERS=$(grep -cE '^\| (Lane [345]|L0) ' tools/evidence/HANDOFF.md)"
git status --porcelain | grep -vE '^(A|M| M|\?\?) (\.github/workflows/|templates/workflows/|tools/evidence/)' | wc -l | tr -d ' '
```

**CORRECT OUTPUT**

```
OK acceptance_matrix checked=20 failed=0
EXIT=0
CONSUMERS=5
0
```

**STOP** — if any DoD row cannot be proved because a decision in §1 is still open, record it as `failed` and do not mark the lane done. `failed=0` is the only closing state. Rule S4; blocker title `BLOCKER L2-T555: DoD-<nn> unprovable, <decision id> still open`.

**CLOSE:** §0.3 close block, `<branch-slug>` = `t555-handoff`. This is the last close block in Lane 2.

---

## 6. Phase exit gates

A phase is not finished because its last task merged. It is finished when its gate command prints its exact line. Run the gate from a clean checkout of `integration`, never from a lane branch. **No lane opens a branch for the next phase until L0 declares the sync point passed** (`master/04-phase-map.md` §4) — passing the gate below is Lane 2's input to that declaration, not the declaration itself.

### 6.1 BT-1 exit gate — bootstrap, guards, the CI job set

Covers tasks 1–30. Proves: the lane owns its trees and nothing else; both guards fail their negative cases; the nine phase-4 contexts and the two phase-5 contexts are emitted by the template; every action is pinned.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration
bash tools/evidence/preflight.sh --summary
python -m tools.evidence.lint_workflow --path .github/workflows --summary
bash tools/evidence/run_negative_tests.sh --summary
python -m tools.evidence.render_template --lint templates/workflows --summary
echo "PIN_ROWS=$(grep -cE '^[a-z0-9._/-]+ v[0-9.]+ [0-9a-f]{40}$' tools/evidence/action-pins.txt)"
echo "UNPINNED_USES=$(grep -rhE '^[[:space:]]+uses:' .github/workflows templates/workflows | grep -cvE '@([0-9a-f]{40}|\{\{WORKFLOWS_TAG\}\})')"
```

**Gate output — all six lines, exactly.** `checked=5` on line 2 is the number of workflow files in `.github/workflows/` at BT-1 exit — `lane-guard.yml`, `ci.yml`, `renovate-path-guard.yml`, `control-plane-ci.yml`, `publish-workflow-tag.yml`. `.gitkeep` is not a workflow and is not counted. `checked=1` on line 4 is the single template that exists at BT-1 exit, `templates/workflows/ci.yml`.

```
OK preflight checked=4 failed=0
OK lint_workflow checked=5 failed=0
OK run_negative_tests checked=6 failed=0
OK render_template checked=1 failed=0
PIN_ROWS=1
UNPINNED_USES=0
```

**Gate STOP** — a non-zero `failed=` on any line means a BT-1 task regressed after merging. Find the task by its file, reopen it, and do not proceed to BT-2. Blocker title `BLOCKER L2 BT-1 GATE: <tool-id> reports failed=<n> on integration`.

### 6.2 BT-2 exit gate — build, digest, SBOM, the four gates

Covers tasks 31–38. Proves: one build implementation; SBOM beside the digest; and the four gate modules each fail their negative fixture and pass their positive one.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration
python -m tools.evidence.lint_workflow --path .github/workflows --summary
python -m tools.evidence.sbom_assert --manifest tools/evidence/fixtures/sbom/good.json --summary
python -m tools.evidence.timegate --at 2026-09-11T15:01:00Z --tz Asia/Kolkata --profile business-hours --summary
python -m tools.evidence.actor_gate --actor machine-1 --capability devops --people tools/evidence/fixtures/actor/people.yaml --summary
python -m tools.evidence.identity_gate --approval tools/evidence/fixtures/identity/self.yaml --deployer dev-1 --summary
python -m tools.evidence.digest_invariant --requested sha256:bbbb --staging-record tools/evidence/fixtures/digest/staging-aaaa.yaml --summary
echo "BUILD_IMPLS=$(grep -rlE 'docker build|buildx|podman build' .github/workflows | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
```

**Gate output — all seven lines, exactly.** The four `FAIL` lines are the gates correctly refusing their negative fixtures; a gate printing `OK` on its negative fixture is the failure.

```
OK lint_workflow checked=6 failed=0
OK sbom_assert checked=2 failed=0
FAIL timegate checked=2 failed=1
FAIL actor_gate checked=3 failed=1
FAIL identity_gate checked=1 failed=1
FAIL digest_invariant checked=1 failed=1
BUILD_IMPLS=1
```

**Gate STOP** — `BUILD_IMPLS` greater than 1 means a second build path exists and invariant 22 is no longer mechanically true. Blocker title `BLOCKER L2 BT-2 GATE: more than one build implementation in .github/workflows`.

### 6.3 BT-3 exit gate — the lane's closing gate

Covers tasks 39–76. Proves every Definition-of-Done row of the charter, the eleven questions, the actor-gate posture, the template manifest, and all four acceptance tests.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration
python -m tools.evidence.acceptance_matrix --summary
python -m tools.evidence.assert_actor_gate_first --path .github/workflows --summary
python -m tools.evidence.check_required_contexts --templates templates/workflows --registry templates/workflows/required-checks.yaml --summary
python -m tools.evidence.evidence_chain --deployment tools/evidence/fixtures/chain/dep-complete.yaml --summary
python -m tools.evidence.render_template --manifest templates/workflows/MANIFEST.yaml --summary
for A in at-024 at-029 at-035 at-103; do bash tools/evidence/at/$A.sh --summary; done
```

**Gate output — all nine lines, exactly**

```
OK acceptance_matrix checked=20 failed=0
OK assert_actor_gate_first checked=5 failed=0
OK check_required_contexts checked=15 failed=0
OK evidence_chain checked=11 failed=0
OK render_template checked=9 failed=0
OK at-024 checked=4 failed=0
OK at-029 checked=3 failed=0
OK at-035 checked=4 failed=0

## 7. Charter Definition-of-Done → task map

Every row of `L2-00-charter.md` §7, mapped to the task that proves it. `acceptance_matrix` (`L2-T555`) executes this table.

| DoD | Criterion, abridged | Proved by | Task |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DoD-01 | all eight reusable workflows exist in `.github/workflows/` | the charter's `for w in …` loop prints nothing | L2-T100, L2-T120, L2-T130, L2-T131, L2-T132, L2-T134, L2-T136, L2-T137 |
| DoD-02 | all required per-product workflows exist as templates | the same loop over `templates/workflows/` prints nothing | L2-T301 … L2-T309, L2-T311 |
| DoD-03 | digest invariant enforced in code and fails closed | negative dispatch exits non-zero and writes **no** deployment record | L2-T543, L2-T131 |
| DoD-04 | identity gate fails closed when approver == deployer | job log contains `APPROVER_EQUALS_DEPLOYER` | L2-T542, L2-T131 |
| DoD-05 | actor gate is the **first** step of all five privileged workflows | `assert_actor_gate_first` exits 0 | L2-T554 |
| DoD-06 | every registry context is emitted by a job with no `if:` and no path filter | `lint_workflow` LW-02/LW-03; adding an `if:` makes it exit non-zero | L2-T533, L2-T537 case N3 |
| DoD-07 | `skipped`/`neutral` impossible on a required context | a no-work run reports `success` with a recorded reason | L2-T535, L2-T537 case N4 |
| DoD-08 | security and licence scanning are delta-gated | seeded legacy finding passes; seeded new finding fails | L2-T536, L2-T103, L2-T104 |
| DoD-09 | SBOM emitted beside the digest for every production build | `sbom_assert` exits 0 on the real build manifest | L2-T538, L2-T120 |
| DoD-10 | Friday-freeze gate resolves in the declared operating timezone | runner TZ Thursday, declared TZ Friday 15:01 → deploy refused | L2-T540 |
| DoD-11 | `renovate-path-guard` fails on out-of-manifest diff **and** foreign-authored commit | two negative tests, both non-zero | L2-T110, L2-T537 cases N5 and N6 |
| DoD-12 | a **passing** seeded-defect case fails the run and raises SIG-18 | `seeded_defect` on `case-passed.json` exits 2 and prints `SIG-18` | L2-T517, L2-T138 |
| DoD-13 | `verify-digest-chain` non-zero on mismatch, 0 on a clean estate | both directions executed | L2-T550, L2-T139 |
| DoD-14 | the eleven questions answerable for one real deployment | `evidence_chain` emits all eleven, none empty, exit 0 | L2-T519 |
| DoD-15 | record and event writes are required, failing steps | record write blocked → deploy job fails | L2-T544, L2-T545, L2-T131 |
| DoD-16 | `restore-production.yml` runs end to end with no human-typed credential | AT-103 executed | L2-T703 |
| DoD-17 | a shared workflow change is caught by canary and reverted by tag revert | AT-024 executed | L2-T700 |
| DoD-18 | organisation export restores, each data class by its own mechanism | AT-035 executed | L2-T702 |
| DoD-19 | production rollback executes manually with the control plane unreachable | AT-029 executed | L2-T701 |
| DoD-20 | no L2 pull request ever touched a foreign path | `lane-guard` green on every L2 PR in the cycle | L2-T004, L2-T109, and the §0.3 close block on every task |

**DoD-20 has a bootstrap hole and it is not yours to close.** D-L2-06 records it: Lane 1 and Lane 4 merge to `integration` before `lane-guard.yml`, an L2 file, exists. For cycle 1 only, DoD-20 is proved from the merge history rather than from a green check. No task changes this.

## 8. Invariant and signal accountability → task map

### 8.1 Invariants (§101, L9443–9600)

Each is `mechanical` and names an L2 enforcement point, per `L2-00-charter.md` §13.

| Invariant | Line | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 18 — the background machine layer cannot merge, approve, deploy or reach production credentials | L9477 | L2-T541 (actor gate, positive dispatch allowlist), L2-T554, L2-T137 |
| 22 — the production artifact is the same digest verified in staging, never rebuilt | L9484 | L2-T543, L2-T120, L2-T131 |
| 23 — never rebuild to work around registry unavailability | L9485 | L2-T120 (`REGISTRY_UNREACHABLE_NO_REBUILD`) |
| 27 — rollback is preferred to hotfix and needs no prior approval during a SEV-1 | L9489 | L2-T133, L2-T309 |
| 28 — non-reversible changes need an explicit recovery strategy and never claim rollback capability | L9490 | L2-T132 case D |
| 71 — platform changes are versioned, impact-analysed, canaried, verified and reversible | L9548 | L2-T112, L2-T143, L2-T700 |
| 72 — portfolio-wide changes never roll to the fleet without passing a canary | L9549 | L2-T143, L2-T301 … L2-T309 (pinned-tag consumption) |
| 80 — every control is explicitly classified fail-closed or fail-open | L9557 | §0.4 fail-closed rule; every `ERROR`/exit-3 path in `tools/evidence/**` |
| 85 — actions pinned to full SHAs, reusable workflows consumed by pinned tag | L9565 | L2-T531, L2-T532, L2-T533 rule LW-01 |
| 87 — every architecture and security policy is enforced by the platform wherever it can be | L9567 | the whole lane; `acceptance_matrix` at L2-T555 |

### 8.2 Signals (§52.2, L4520–4587)

Lane 2 produces the source data. Lane 4 computes and Lane 5 presents; Lane 2 builds neither the computation nor the dashboard.

| Signal | Line | Fed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SIG-12 — stale platform versions | L4541 | the pinned SHAs recorded by L2-T532 and asserted by L2-T533 |
| SIG-14 — failed canary deployments | L4543 | the canary exercise legs of L2-T143 |
| SIG-17 — restore-test currency | L4546 | the restore-test records written by L2-T134, and the rotation of L2-T552 / L2-T141 |
| SIG-18 — verification-contract coverage gaps | L4547 | the seeded-defect execution of L2-T517, surfaced by L2-T138 |
| SIG-34 — organisation export staleness | L4563 | the export job telemetry of L2-T136 |
| SIG-42 — AI-eval regression | L4571 | the pin-change CI leg; `records/eval/` is Lane 4's store |

---

## 9. What Lane 2 does not build — do not attempt any of these

| Not built here | Owner | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The `affected:` blast-radius generator, the bulk fleet-migration PR script, the change-matrix scaffold | **unassigned** — route to L0 as D-L2-01 | `tools/fleet/**` appears in no lane's OWNS column in `PARTITION.md` v1 |
| The contract and registry validators themselves | L1 | `validators/registry/**`, `schemas/**`, `registries/**` are Lane 1's (`PARTITION.md` line 17). Lane 2 invokes them through the D-L2-02 entrypoint |
| The reconciler, the live declared-versus-actual comparison, `create-product`'s rendering | L3 | `reconciler/**`, `tools/provision/**`, `validators/drift/**` are Lane 3's. Lane 2 publishes templates and a manifest; Lane 3 renders them |
| The record and event schemas, the record stores, the metric computations | L4 | `schemas/records/**`, `metrics/**`, `tools/records/**` and all of `control-plane-records` are Lane 4's (`PARTITION.md` line 20). Lane 2 writes through a client |
| Branch protection, rulesets, the tag ruleset on `workflows/*`, environment policies, secret provisioning, export storage and key custody | L5 | `access/**`, `infra/**`, `ops-vm/**`, `assets/**` are Lane 5's. `L2-T112` cuts the tag; it does not protect it |
| Grafana dashboards, DevLake ingestion, Prometheus scrape configuration for `/health` and `/metrics` | L5 | §41.2's private scrape path is the operations VM's, not a workflow's |
| Anything under `contracts/**` | L0 | Contract-first, `PARTITION.md` rule 2. A needed change is a Contract Change Request, never an edit |
| `tools/__init__.py` | nobody | `tools/` is a shared parent across three lanes; `tools.evidence` is a PEP 420 namespace package (§0.1) |
| The plan-time half of the slopsquat check | §30.2, not this lane | Lane 2 builds the execute-time half in CI only (`L2-T105`) |
| Subsystems G, H, J, O and P | **unassigned in `PARTITION.md` v1** | If a task appears to need one, state the dependency and route it to L0. Never claim it |

## 10. Closing notes for the executor

1. **The `#` column is the order; the `ID` column is the identity.** Ids are namespaced by artifact tree (§0.9), so they are not monotonic in execution order. `L2-T530` is task 7 and `L2-T144` is task 71. Working the ids in numeric order builds the lane in the wrong order and every dependency line will tell you so.

2. **Where an id is defined by a phase file, the phase file is authoritative — not this table.** `L2-04-evidence-chain.md` §6 owns `L2-T500`–`L2-T516`; `L2-02-digest-invariant.md` §3 owns `L2-T520`–`L2-T528`; `L2-03-production-gates.md` §7 owns `L2-T170`–`L2-T177` and `L2-T570`–`L2-T572`. This file no longer publishes a body under any of those ids — it carries an index entry, listed in **§2.1**, and the work it used to publish under a colliding id is unchanged but renumbered into `L2-T530`–`L2-T555`. If a dependency line names one of the phase-file ids, it means the phase-file task. If a reference still leaves you genuinely unsure which unit of work is meant, that is rule S4: stop and ask L0, do not pick one.

3. **Eight decisions belong to L0**, not to you: D-L2-01 through D-L2-08 in §1. Six are carried from the charter, two are new here. This file is written assuming the ratifications stated in D-L2-07 and D-L2-08; if L0 ratifies otherwise, `L2-T530` and `L2-T300` are STOPs and the file is reissued. A ninth decision is not yours to invent — it is a blocker.

4. **Half this file exists to make one sentence mechanically true**: *"Every required check name is therefore emitted by a job carrying no `if:` and no path filter"* (§33.2, L2854–2869). The cheapest way to make any red check green is an `if:`, and it is the one edit that turns the whole gate apparatus into decoration. `lint_workflow` rule LW-02 and negative case N3 exist because that edit is tempting and reads as harmless.

5. **Every `ERROR` and every exit `3` in this file is deliberate.** §0.4's fail-closed rule has no exceptions: an unreachable registry, an absent baseline, an unparseable record and an empty estate are all failures, never passes. If you find yourself writing a branch that returns success because it could not tell, you have found the bug the lane was built to prevent (§101 invariant 80, L9557).

6. **You never write outside `.github/workflows/**`, `templates/workflows/**` and `tools/evidence/**`.** Not once, not for a one-line fix, not for a test fixture, not to unblock another lane. The close block in §0.3 checks this before every push, and DoD-20 checks it across the whole cycle history.

7. **When a shortcut and a rule in §0.6 disagree, the rule wins and the shortcut becomes a blocker issue.** All six rules are transcribed from the spec and none of them bends for a deadline, an incident, or a reviewer who says it is fine.

8. **Six ids in the §2 table are defined by the charter, not by this file.** `L2-T001`–`L2-T006` — rows 1 to 6 — carry an index entry in §3 and no body. `L2-00-charter.md` §11 holds the authoritative body for all six, including every criterion and STOP rule that once appeared only here; §2.1 lists them beside the twenty-six ids resolved before them. Two consequences you will meet on day one. First, rows 1–6 share the **single** branch `lane/2/phase0-charter` that `L2-T001` opens and `L2-T006` publishes; the §0.3 one-branch-per-task protocol starts at row 7, `L2-T530`. Second, `tools/evidence/preflight.sh` as the charter builds it prints `PREFLIGHT_PASS` and does **not** implement §0.4's `--summary` line — that conflict is recorded and routed to L0 in the charter's `L2-T005` block, and row 6's acceptance command in §2 already expects `PREFLIGHT_PASS`. Build what the charter block says, file the blocker it names, and keep going.

---

**End of L2-05.** Work the §2 table top to bottom by the `#` column. Execute each task from its block in §3, §4 or §5. Gate with §6. Prove with §7. Stop with §0.8.
