### L3-P0-CMP10 — Lifecycle vs Renovate monitoring

**Ported from** `lanes/L3-01-diff-engine.md` task L3-01-12 by Session 12 (FD-B1-L3 corollary)
**Spec:** §53.1 row 10 ("Auto-repair where safe; alert otherwise"); §18.1 (lifecycle states: `active | maintenance | paused | sunset | archived`); §33.2 (Renovate disposition policy)
**Files:** `reconciler/comparators/cmp_10_lifecycle.py`, `reconciler/comparators/lifecycle-expectations.yaml`, `reconciler/comparators/tests/test_cmp_10.py`

The safe/unsafe split is read from `lifecycle-expectations.yaml`, never decided in code. A safe row proposes a Level-3 repair (proposed only — rule R1). An unsafe row raises an Amber alert at Level 2 and proposes nothing. Exactly two checks are unsafe: `repository-archived-flag` and `ci-workflow-present` (§53.2 Level-3 "Applies to" list is closed; neither is on it).

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# Ported from lanes/L3-01-diff-engine.md by Session 12 (FD-B1-L3 corollary)

### L3-P0-CMP12 — Shared Service registry dependency check

**Ported from** `lanes/L3-01-diff-engine.md` task L3-01-14 by Session 12 (FD-B1-L3 corollary)
**Spec:** §53.1 rows 11 and 12; §10.2; §12.2; §20.1 ("A product cannot declare a dependency on a shared service that does not exist in the registry"); invariant 55
**Files:** `reconciler/comparators/cmp_11_expired_access.py`, `reconciler/comparators/cmp_12_dependencies.py`, `reconciler/comparators/tests/test_cmp_11_12.py`
**Registry keys:** CMP-11 → `product.yaml`; CMP-12 → `services`

CMP-12 is the only comparator that issues **no API call at all**: both sides are declared state. It still counts rows and still fails the run's `services` count if it narrows. CMP-12 iterates the service registry one Row per declared service so that `rows_compared` for the `services` key reaches `rows_declared`.

**STOP** — if `registries/services/` does not exist, STOP and file the blocker `Blocked-on: L1`. CMP-12's declared side has no source; its `rows_declared` would be `0`, making the comparison vacuously clean (EC-109). Do not execute the proposed revoke; do not call the team-membership removal endpoint.

### L3-P0-AT001 — create-product scaffold conformance verifier

**Ported from** `lanes/L3-04-provisioning.md` task L3-04-12 by Session 12 (FD-B1-L3 corollary)
**Spec:** §19.1 ("Automatic discovery is mandatory. … If a human must edit a dashboard to add a product, that is a defect in the operating system, not a task."); §11 (no hard-coded repository list); invariant 52; AT-001 ("No dashboard, workflow or script contains a product list"); §20.2; §92.3
**Files:** `tools/provision/provision/steps/surfaces.py`, `tools/provision/provision/ops/verify_surfaces.py`, `tools/provision/provision/surfaces/surfaces.yaml`, `tools/provision/tests/test_verify_surfaces.py`

This task adds no registration call. Registration is a consequence of the registry entry. The task builds the verifier that proves it. Static check runs with no dashboard server in existence. A hit in a dashboard JSON, workflow, script or config file is a defect, reported as `HARD-CODED-PRODUCT: <path>:<line>` and exits 3.

Expected output (last line, exactly): `SELF-VERIFY L3-P0-AT001: PASS`

**STOP** — if the static check reports `HARD-CODED-PRODUCT` in a path outside `tools/provision/**`, do not fix it. File the §0.6 blocker titled `BLOCKER L3-P0-AT001: hard-coded product list found in <path>` quoting the exact `path:line`, and route to the owning lane through L0.

### L3-P0-DEL14 — 14-day delegation expiry warning

**Ported from** `lanes/L3-05-orphans.md` task L3-05-26 by Session 12 (FD-B1-L3 corollary)
**Spec:** §10.1 line 787 ("Delegation expiry is warned, never silent. Every delegation-type assignment receives a 14-day advance expiry warning in the daily expiry check, exactly as expiring assets do (Section 49).")
**Files:** `reconciler/expiry/warnings.py`, `reconciler/tests/expiry/test_delegation_warning.py`, fixtures `reconciler/tests/fixtures/expiry/DELEGATION-WARN/**`, `reconciler/tests/fixtures/expiry/DELEGATION-NO-WARN/**`

**STOP** — if `DELEGATION_WARNING_TYPES` is `None` (DR-L3-05-B unresolved), STOP and file the blocker. §10.1 line 787 states 14 days; do not make it configurable, do not read it from a registry, and do not align it with the 30-day asset threshold of §49.1 — those are different clocks on different objects.

# L3-06 — Lane 3 Atomic Task List

# Phase-to-file mapping (FD-B1-L3: L3-06-tasks.md is authoritative — FD-045 superseded by FD-B1-L3 2026-09-02)

**Lane 3 — Reconciler & Provisioning.** Subsystems **C** (Reconciliation engine) and **D** (Provisioning and scaffolding), spec §99.2.
**Branch prefix:** `lane/3/*` · **Merge train position:** 4th (L1 → L4 → L2 → **L3** → L5), per `PARTITION.md`.
**Owned paths (exclusive):** `reconciler/**`, `tools/provision/**`, `validators/drift/**`.

This file is the complete, ordered work list for Lane 3. Work it **top to bottom**. Every task below is executable without opening another document. Do not skip, do not reorder, do not batch.

> §99.6 risk 6: *"the reconciler is the highest-privilege identity in the system"* and auto-repair is *"the most dangerous code"*. Every rule in §0.3 below exists because of that sentence. None of them is optional.

---

## 0. Standing protocol — read once, apply to every task

### 0.1 Path ownership (hard)

You may create or edit files **only** under these three roots:

```
reconciler/**
tools/provision/**
validators/drift/**
```

You may **read** anything in the repository. You may **never write** to `contracts/**`, `schemas/**`, `registries/**`, `.github/workflows/**`, `validators/registry/**`, `tools/evidence/**`, `access/**`, `infra/**`, `ops-vm/**`, `metrics/**`, `records/**`, `events/**`, `CODEOWNERS`, `Makefile`, or any root file. A pull request touching a foreign path fails the lane-guard check and is rejected (`PARTITION.md` rule 1).

**Namespace-package rule.** Do **not** create `tools/__init__.py` or `validators/__init__.py`. Those two directories are shared parents owned by other lanes. `tools.provision` and `validators.drift` import as PEP 420 implicit namespace packages. Creating either `__init__.py` is a foreign-path write and will be rejected.

### 0.2 Git protocol — every task, no exceptions

Start of every task:

```bash
[ -n "$CP" ] || { echo "ERROR: CP is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CP"
git fetch origin
git checkout integration
git pull --ff-only origin integration
git checkout -b lane/3/<task-slug>
```

End of every task (after its acceptance command passes):

```bash
git add <the exact files named in the task>
git commit -m "<TASK-ID>: <task title>"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration
git push -u origin lane/3/<task-slug>
gh pr create --base integration --title "<TASK-ID>: <task title>" --body "Lane 3. Task <TASK-ID>. Acceptance command in L3-06-tasks.md passed."
```

One branch per task. Never merge another lane's branch. Never rebase another lane's branch.

### 0.3 The five reconciler safety rules — enforced in code, tested, never relaxed

These are transcribed from §53.3, §101 invariant 81, §40.1 and §99.6 risk 6. Any task whose implementation would violate one of these is a STOP.

1. **Stricter-only.** A repair is permitted only when it moves actual state toward declared state **and** declared state is at least as restrictive as actual state. Where actual is stricter than declared, emit Level 2 and repair nothing (§53.3, AT-033).
2. **Never loosen, never touch runtime, never touch data, never touch secrets.** Reconciliation never relaxes a control, never modifies production runtime configuration, never modifies data, never rotates or writes secrets (§53.3).
3. **Detect before repair.** Every repair class ships **disabled by default** and is enabled one class at a time by explicit configuration (§98.2 Phase 3; §98.3; §99.4 item 6).
4. **The reconciler credential is bounded and the bound is executed, not asserted.** Six negative attempts must fail: GitHub Actions secret write, environment write, workflow-file change, organisation-settings change, `records/**` write, any Layer B access (AT-110, §40.1).
5. **The instrument is suspect by default.** A run reporting zero findings — including the seeded canary — is a **FAILED** run, not a clean one (§53.1 seeded-canary rule; AT-102).

### 0.4 Where this lane's output runs (it is not this lane's job to schedule it)

| Artifact | Built by | Scheduled / wired by | Do not build it here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reconciler program | **L3** (`reconciler/**`) | L5 (`ops-vm/**` timer) | the systemd unit |
| Independent control verifier program | **L3** (`validators/drift/**`) | L2 (`.github/workflows/**` scheduled workflow) | the workflow YAML |
| Provisioning CLI | **L3** (`tools/provision/**`) | invoked by a human DevOps-capability holder (§19.1) | any workflow that calls it |

Consequence, binding on every task in this file: **every acceptance command and every SELF-VERIFY command must run locally, offline, against a fixture.** No task's acceptance may depend on a live GitHub organisation, a running CI job, or another lane's merged branch. Tasks that must eventually touch live GitHub ship a fixture-backed adapter and a `--live` flag that is never exercised in acceptance.

### 0.5 Deterministic output contract (used by every SELF-VERIFY in this file)

Every comparator and every operation prints exactly one summary line to stdout on `--summary`:

```
<STATUS> <id> findings=<int> compared=<int>
```

`STATUS` is `OK` when the module executed, `FAIL` when it could not execute. `findings` counts drift findings emitted. `compared` counts rows actually compared (§53.1: *"Every run additionally records its per-registry comparison counts"*). Run level prints one additional line:

```
CANARY <found|missing>
```

Exit codes, fixed: `0` = executed, no Blocking findings. `2` = executed, at least one Blocking finding. `3` = run FAILED (instrument failure, canary missing). Any other non-zero = crash, which is a STOP.

**`--only` suppression rule.** When `--only <comparator-id>` is given, the CLI runs one comparator only and suppresses the canary-missing rule. The summary prints `CANARY n/a` (not `CANARY missing`) and the exit code is `0` or `2` only — never `3`. The `3 = FAILED` rule applies exclusively to full (non-`--only`) runs. Phase-1 SELF-VERIFYs that use `--only` must therefore expect exit `0` or `2` with `CANARY n/a` once `L3-P1-17` is merged; before `L3-P1-17` exists the canary module is absent and the output is `CANARY missing` with exit `0` or `2` (unchanged).

### 0.6 STOP rule and blocker-issue template

**Standing STOP rule.** If a task's stated STOP condition occurs, if any command errors in a way the task does not describe, if a file you must edit is outside §0.1, or if a fact you need is not written in this file — **stop, commit nothing, and file the blocker below.** Do not guess, do not substitute, do not proceed to the next task.

```bash
gh issue create --title "BLOCKER <TASK-ID>: <one-line symptom>" --label blocker,lane-3 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
blocked_task: <TASK-ID>
lane: 3
branch: lane/3/<task-slug>
stop_condition_hit: <quote the STOP line from L3-06-tasks.md verbatim>
command_run: |
  <the exact command>
observed_output: |
  <paste verbatim, do not summarise>
expected_output: |
  <paste the SELF-VERIFY expected block verbatim>
files_touched_so_far: <list, or "none">
decision_required_from: L0
EOF
)"
```

Then post the issue number in the lane channel and take the next **unblocked** task, or idle. Never work around a blocker.

## 1. DECISION REQUIRED — the four decisions L0 owns

These are design choices. The spec does not settle them and the executor has no authority to settle them. **L3-D1 and L3-D2 block the start of the lane**: work stops at L3-P0-02 until L0 records an answer in `docs/` and links it here. **L3-D3** blocks two Phase 5 tasks only. **L3-D4** is stated in full at §5 below, where it applies, and blocks nothing — its interim behaviour is defined there.

| Decision | Question in one line | Blocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L3-D1** | implementation language, runtime version, dependency pinning | L3-P0-02 and therefore everything |
| **L3-D2** | the five `contracts/**` paths Lane 3 reads | L3-P0-03 and its dependants |
| **L3-D3** | Closed: L3-D3 resolved — GitHub App credential confirmed. | L3-P5-06, L3-P5-07 |
| **L3-D4** | drift class for orphan severities `High` and `Medium` (stated at §5) | nothing — interim behaviour defined |

### DECISION REQUIRED — L3-D1: implementation language and runtime

**Question.** What language, runtime version and dependency-pinning mechanism do `reconciler/**`, `tools/provision/**` and `validators/drift/**` use?
**Why L0.** §99.5 fixes the git host, CI, dashboards, records format and identity bridge. It does not fix the implementation language of subsystems C and D. Choosing one is architecture.
**Constraint from spec.** §101 invariant 85: third-party dependencies are pinned. §99.1: *"a schema-and-validator suite, a reconciliation engine, a provisioning and scaffolding CLI"* — scripts and CLIs, not an application.
**This file is written assuming L0 ratifies:** Python 3.12, dependencies pinned by exact `==` version in `reconciler/requirements.txt`, no lockfile generator.
**If L0 ratifies anything else:** STOP at L3-P0-02 and file the blocker; this whole file needs reissuing by L0.

### DECISION REQUIRED — L3-D2: the contract filenames Lane 3 consumes

**Question.** Give the exact frozen paths under `contracts/**` for the five artifacts Lane 3 reads. Lane 3 never edits them (`PARTITION.md` rule 2).
**The five roles Lane 3 needs a contract for:**

| Role | What Lane 3 does with it | Spec anchor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drift finding | the object every comparator emits | §53.1, §53.4 |
| Reconciliation run record | the object each run writes | §53.1 *"Every reconciliation run writes its result"* |
| Repair record | the object each Level-3 repair writes | §26.4 *"logged as repair records"* |
| Branch-protection template | the declared side of the §53.1 protection row | §11.3 |
| Environment template | the declared side of the §53.1 environment rows | §33.4 |

**Why L0.** `contracts/**` is L0-owned and frozen in Phase 0. Lane 3 guessing a filename produces a lane that compiles against nothing.
**Discovery aid for L0:** `ls -1 contracts/`
**Until answered:** L3-P0-03 is blocked, and every task depending on it is blocked.

### Binding: L3-D3 resolved — reconciler machine identity: GitHub App credential confirmed (was: DECISION REQUIRED — reconciler machine identity form and test organisation)

**Question.** Is the reconciler credential a GitHub App installation token or a fine-grained PAT, and what organisation login do `--live` smoke runs target?
**Why L0.** §40.1 allows either (*"a least-privilege GitHub App or fine-grained PAT"*) and D80 states a preference (*"machine identities prefer GitHub Apps over seat accounts where the mechanism allows"*) without deciding. The App-vs-PAT choice changes the auth code path and the AT-110 probe shape.
**Blocks:** L3-P5-06 (AT-110 probe), L3-P5-07 (behavioural envelope), L3-P8-05 (lane acceptance-matrix runner), and L3-P8-06 (lane handoff manifest). Fixture-backed tasks proceed without it; L3-P8-05 and L3-P8-06 do not, because L3-P8-05's AT traceability matrix maps AT-110 → L3-P5-06 and therefore cannot report `MATRIX passed=11 total=11` until this decision is recorded.

## 2. Master task table — all 78 tasks in execution order

Work top to bottom. `Deps` are task ids that must be **merged to `integration`** first.

## 3. Phase 0 — Lane bootstrap and harness

Goal: a package that imports, a fixture that is the single source of every expected number in this file, and a finding model carrying the §53.4 scale. Nothing here touches GitHub.

### L3-P0-01 — Lane tree and ownership marker

**Phase** 0 · **Size** S · **Deps** — · **Spec** `PARTITION.md` §"STRICT path ownership"

**Files (create):** `reconciler/README.md`, `tools/provision/README.md`, `validators/drift/README.md`

```bash
set -euo pipefail
[ -n "$CP" ] || { echo "ERROR: CP is not set"; exit 1; }
cd "$CP" && git fetch origin && git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration
git checkout -b lane/3/p0-01-lane-tree
mkdir -p reconciler tools/provision validators/drift
printf '%s\n' '# reconciler - Lane 3 (Subsystem C). Owned exclusively by lane/3/*.' > reconciler/README.md
printf '%s\n' '# tools/provision - Lane 3 (Subsystem D). Owned exclusively by lane/3/*.' > tools/provision/README.md
printf '%s\n' '# validators/drift - Lane 3 independent control verifier (spec 53.1).' > validators/drift/README.md
git add reconciler/README.md tools/provision/README.md validators/drift/README.md
git commit -m "L3-P0-01: lane tree and ownership marker"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p0-01-lane-tree
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P0-01: lane tree and ownership marker" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P0-01."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. The three README files exist and each names its lane and subsystem.
2. `git diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD` lists nothing outside the three owned roots.
3. `tools/__init__.py` and `validators/__init__.py` do **not** exist (§0.1 namespace rule).

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
ls reconciler/README.md tools/provision/README.md validators/drift/README.md && test ! -e tools/__init__.py && test ! -e validators/__init__.py && echo "P0-01 OK"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
reconciler/README.md
tools/provision/README.md
validators/drift/README.md
P0-01 OK
```

**STOP** — if `tools/__init__.py` or `validators/__init__.py` already exists on `integration`, do not delete it and do not proceed: another lane owns that parent. File the blocker (§0.6).

**Phase** 0 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P0-01, **DECISION L3-D1** · **Spec** §99.1; §101 invariant 85

**Files (create):** `reconciler/__init__.py`, `reconciler/requirements.txt`, `reconciler/scripts/check-ownership.sh`, `reconciler/tests/__init__.py`, `tools/provision/tests/__init__.py`, `validators/drift/tests/__init__.py`

Create the directories, then write the three content files exactly as specified.

`reconciler/__init__.py` — one line: `__version__ = "0.1.0"`

`reconciler/requirements.txt` — exactly two lines, both `==`-pinned:

```
PyYAML==6.0.2
pytest==8.3.3
```

`reconciler/scripts/check-ownership.sh` — a bash script with `set -euo pipefail` that (a) reads `git diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD` and fails, printing `FOREIGN PATHS:` and the offending lines, if any path does not start with `reconciler/`, `tools/provision/` or `validators/drift/`; (b) fails printing `NAMESPACE VIOLATION` if `tools/__init__.py` or `validators/__init__.py` exists; (c) otherwise prints `OWNERSHIP OK` and exits 0.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p0-02-package
mkdir -p reconciler/scripts reconciler/tests tools/provision/tests validators/drift/tests
# write the three content files described above, plus the three empty tests/__init__.py markers
chmod +x reconciler/scripts/check-ownership.sh
python -m pip install -r reconciler/requirements.txt
python -c "import reconciler; print('ok')"
git add reconciler tools/provision/tests validators/drift/tests
git commit -m "L3-P0-02: package skeleton and pinned deps"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p0-02-package
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P0-02: package skeleton and pinned deps" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P0-02."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `python -c "import reconciler"` succeeds from the repository root.
2. `reconciler/requirements.txt` pins every dependency with `==`; no `>=`, no `~=`, no wildcard (§101 invariant 85).
3. `reconciler/scripts/check-ownership.sh` exits 0 on this branch.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -c "import reconciler; print('ok')" && ! grep -Eq '(>=|~=|\*)' reconciler/requirements.txt && bash reconciler/scripts/check-ownership.sh
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
ok
OWNERSHIP OK
```

**STOP** — if L0 has not recorded an answer to **L3-D1**, do not start. If L0 ratified any runtime other than Python 3.12, STOP: every command in this file assumes Python 3.12, and the file must be reissued by L0.

---

### L3-P0-03 — Contract map module

**Phase** 0 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P0-02, **DECISION L3-D2** · **Spec** `PARTITION.md` rule 2; §53.1; §26.4

**Files (create):** `reconciler/contracts_map.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_contracts_map.py`

Write `reconciler/contracts_map.py` containing exactly one dictionary named `CONTRACTS` with these five keys — `drift_finding`, `run_record`, `repair_record`, `branch_protection_template`, `environment_template` — whose values are the five paths L0 recorded in **L3-D2**, copied verbatim. Add one function `load(key)` reading the JSON at `CONTRACTS[key]` and raising `FileNotFoundError` naming the key when the path is absent.

Write `reconciler/tests/test_contracts_map.py` with four tests asserting: all five keys present and no sixth; every value starts with `contracts/`; every value exists on disk; `load()` returns a `dict` for each key.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p0-03-contracts-map
ls -1 contracts/
# write the two files, copying the five paths verbatim from L0's L3-D2 answer
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_contracts_map.py -q
git add reconciler/contracts_map.py reconciler/tests/test_contracts_map.py
git commit -m "L3-P0-03: contract map module"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p0-03-contracts-map
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P0-03: contract map module" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P0-03."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `CONTRACTS` has exactly the five keys named above, no more.
2. No value is invented: each is copied verbatim from L0's L3-D2 answer.
3. No file under `contracts/` is created or modified.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_contracts_map.py -q && echo "foreign-contract-writes=$(git diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD | grep -c '^contracts/')"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
4 passed
foreign-contract-writes=0
```

**STOP** — if any path in L3-D2's answer does not exist under `contracts/`, do not create it and do not substitute a similar filename. File the blocker naming the missing path.

### L3-P0-04 — Fixture set `fixture-a`

**Phase** 0 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P0-02 · **Spec** §53.1; §12.2; §11.3; §33.4; §40.1

`fixture-a` is **the single source of every expected number in this file.** Create it exactly as written. Every later SELF-VERIFY count derives from these contents; changing one value silently breaks tasks 9 through 78.

**Files (create):** `reconciler/fixtures/__init__.py`, `reconciler/fixtures/verify.py`, and the sixteen fixture data files below.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p0-04-fixture-a

Then write `reconciler/fixtures/verify.py` — a `__main__` entry taking one positional fixture name, which loads all sixteen data files above, asserts each exists and parses, and prints exactly one line: `FIXTURE <name> files=<int> people=<int> products=<int>`. Also create the empty package marker `reconciler/fixtures/__init__.py`.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
python -m reconciler.fixtures.verify fixture-a
git add reconciler/fixtures
git commit -m "L3-P0-04: fixture-a"

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P0-04: fixture-a" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P0-04."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All sixteen data files plus `verify.py` and `__init__.py` exist, with exactly the content shown.
2. `verify.py` parses all of them without error.
3. No fixture file names a real GitHub organisation, a real person's login, or any credential.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.fixtures.verify fixture-a
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
FIXTURE fixture-a files=16 people=5 products=2
```

**STOP** — if `files=` is anything other than `16`, you have added or omitted a fixture data file. Do not adjust the expected number; restore the list above exactly. If it still differs, file the blocker.

### L3-P0-05 — Finding model, drift classes, levels

**Phase** 0 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P0-03 · **Spec** §53.4 (four classes); §53.2 (five levels); §6.7

**Files (create):** `reconciler/model.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_model.py`

Write `reconciler/model.py` containing exactly:

* `class DriftClass(str, Enum)` with exactly four members: `GREEN`, `AMBER`, `RED`, `BLOCKING`. No fifth member. Module docstring quotes §53.4: *"There is exactly one drift severity scale, used everywhere."*
* `class Level(IntEnum)` with exactly five members: `DETECT=1`, `WARN=2`, `AUTO_REPAIR=3`, `BLOCK=4`, `ESCALATE=5`.
* `RESPONSE_TIME`, transcribed cell for cell from the §53.4 table: `GREEN -> None`, `AMBER -> "next_planning_cycle_h2"`, `RED -> "2_business_days"`, `BLOCKING -> "immediate"`.
* `BLOCKS_WORK`, transcribed cell for cell from the §53.4 table: `GREEN -> False`, `AMBER -> False`, `RED -> False`, `BLOCKING -> True`.
* `@dataclass(frozen=True) class Finding` with fields `id: str`, `comparator: str`, `scope: str`, `drift_class: DriftClass`, `level: Level`, `evidence: str`, `first_seen: str`, `acknowledged_by: str | None = None`, `acknowledged_at: str | None = None`, `external_cause: str | None = None`, `gap_window: bool = False`.
* `def security_floor(drift_class, is_security_or_prod_env)` returning `RED` when the input is `GREEN` or `AMBER` and the flag is true, else the input unchanged — §53.4: *"Security drift and production environment drift are never classified below Red."*

Write six tests asserting: exactly four `DriftClass` members; exactly five `Level` members; `RESPONSE_TIME` matches §53.4; `BLOCKS_WORK` matches §53.4; `security_floor(GREEN, True) is RED` and `security_floor(BLOCKING, True) is BLOCKING`; `Finding` is immutable (attribute assignment raises).

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p0-05-model
# write the two files
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_model.py -q
git add reconciler/model.py reconciler/tests/test_model.py
git commit -m "L3-P0-05: finding model, drift classes, levels"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p0-05-model
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P0-05: finding model, drift classes, levels" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P0-05."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `len(DriftClass) == 4` and `len(Level) == 5`.
2. No retired severity vocabulary is used as a value or member name anywhere in the module (§53.4: *"No other severity vocabulary exists anywhere in this system"*).
3. `Finding` is frozen.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_model.py -q && python -c "
from reconciler.model import DriftClass, Level
print('classes', len(DriftClass), 'levels', len(Level))"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
6 passed
classes 4 levels 5
```

**STOP** — if a later task appears to need a fifth drift class or a sixth level, stop: that is a spec change, not an implementation choice. File the blocker addressed to L0.

---

### L3-P0-06 — `GitHubState` port and fixture adapter

**Phase** 0 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P0-04, L3-P0-05 · **Spec** §0.4 above; §53.1; §53.3

**Files (create):** `reconciler/state/__init__.py`, `reconciler/state/port.py`, `reconciler/state/fixture_adapter.py`, `reconciler/state/live_adapter.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_state.py`

Write `port.py` with abstract class `GitHubState` exposing exactly these twelve read methods and **no write method of any kind**: `org_members()`, `team_members(product)`, `branch_protection(repo)`, `environments(repo)`, `codeowners(repo)`, `workflow_files(repo)`, `resolve_tag(tag)`, `rulesets()`, `bypass_branches()`, `check_runs(repo)`, `store_last_write()`, `restore_test_records()`.

Write `fixture_adapter.py` (`class FixtureState`) implementing every method by reading `reconciler/fixtures/<name>/actual/`. Write `live_adapter.py` implementing the same interface against the GitHub REST API, gated behind an explicit `--live` flag; it is never exercised by any acceptance command in this file.

Tests assert: `GitHubState` has zero methods whose name begins `set_`, `write_`, `create_`, `delete_`, `update_` or `put_`; `FixtureState('fixture-a')` returns 5 org members, an alpha team of 5, and a beta team of 1.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p0-06-state
# write the five files
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_state.py -q
git add reconciler/state reconciler/tests/test_state.py
git commit -m "L3-P0-06: GitHubState port and fixture adapter"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p0-06-state
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P0-06: GitHubState port and fixture adapter" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P0-06."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `GitHubState` exposes read methods only. This is the mechanical half of safety rule 2 (§0.3): the detect path physically cannot write.
2. The fixture adapter reads only from `reconciler/fixtures/**`.
3. `live_adapter.py` issues no request unless `--live` is passed.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_state.py -q && python -c "
from reconciler.state.fixture_adapter import FixtureState
s=FixtureState('fixture-a')
print('members', len(s.org_members()), 'alpha', len(s.team_members('alpha')), 'beta', len(s.team_members('beta')))"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
5 passed
members 5 alpha 5 beta 1
```

**STOP** — if a comparator later seems to need a write method on `GitHubState`, stop. Writes belong only to `reconciler/repair/**` behind the Phase 6 enablement registry. File the blocker.

---

### L3-P0-07 — Run record writer and summary line

**Phase** 0 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P0-06 · **Spec** §53.1 *"Every reconciliation run writes its result, and a clean run is recorded as clean"*; §0.5 above; §40.1 (D89)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/runrecord.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_runrecord.py`

Write `runrecord.py` with `class RunRecord` holding `run_id`, `started_at`, `finished_at`, `status` (`OK` | `FAILED`), `findings: list[Finding]`, `comparison_counts: dict[str, int]`, `canary_found: bool`, `external_cause: str | None`. Provide `to_dict()` shaped to the `run_record` contract from `contracts_map`; `summary_lines()` returning the §0.5 lines in order (one per comparator, then the `CANARY` line); and `write(path)` serialising to YAML that **raises** if `path` starts with `records/` or `events/`.

Five tests: summary format byte-exact; a zero-finding record still serialises with `status` present; `write()` refuses `records/`; `write()` refuses `events/`; `to_dict()` keys match the contract's required key list.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p0-07-runrecord
# write the two files
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_runrecord.py -q
git add reconciler/runrecord.py reconciler/tests/test_runrecord.py
git commit -m "L3-P0-07: run record writer and summary line"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p0-07-runrecord
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P0-07: run record writer and summary line" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P0-07."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Summary lines match §0.5 byte for byte.
2. `write()` refuses any path under `records/` or `events/` — safety rule 4, and negative attempt 5 of AT-110.
3. A clean run produces a record, not an empty file (§53.1: *"a clean run is recorded as clean"*).

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_runrecord.py -q && python -c "
from reconciler.runrecord import RunRecord
r=RunRecord(run_id='R1',started_at='2026-08-27T00:00:00Z',finished_at='2026-08-27T00:01:00Z',status='OK',findings=[],comparison_counts={'demo':3},canary_found=True,external_cause=None)
print('\n'.join(r.summary_lines()))
try:
    r.write('records/x.yaml'); print('LEAK')
except Exception: print('REFUSED records/')"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
5 passed
OK demo findings=0 compared=3
CANARY found
REFUSED records/
```

**STOP** — if a later task appears to require writing the run record into the records repository, stop: `records/**` belongs to Lane 4 and the reconciler credential must not reach it (§40.1 D89; AT-110). File the blocker requesting a contract-mediated handoff.

---

## 4. Phase 1 — The comparison set (detect only)

Every task in this phase adds exactly one row of the §53.1 declared-versus-actual table, or one instrument-integrity control. **No repair code is written in this phase** (§98.2 Phase 3: *"Auto-repair is not built here"*).

Each comparator module exposes one function `compare(declared, actual, as_of) -> tuple[list[Finding], int]` returning findings and the compared-row count, and registers itself under its `id`.

---

### L3-P1-01 — Comparator registry and `reconciler.cli`

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P0-07 · **Spec** §53.1; §0.5 above

**Files (create):** `reconciler/registry.py`, `reconciler/cli.py`, `reconciler/comparators/__init__.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_cli.py`

`registry.py`: a `COMPARATORS: dict[str, Callable]` populated by a `@comparator("<id>")` decorator, each registration also declaring the comparator's fail mode class (consumed in L3-P1-19). `cli.py`: subcommands `list` (prints each registered id, one per line, sorted) and `run` with flags `--fixture <name>`, `--only <id>` (repeatable), `--as-of <YYYY-MM-DD>` (default: today, UTC), `--summary`, `--format json`, `--live`. Exit codes per §0.5.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-01-registry
# write the four files
python -m reconciler.cli list
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_cli.py -q
git add reconciler/registry.py reconciler/cli.py reconciler/comparators reconciler/tests/test_cli.py
git commit -m "L3-P1-01: comparator registry and CLI"

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-01: comparator registry and CLI" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-01."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `python -m reconciler.cli list` exits 0 and prints nothing (no comparator is registered yet).
2. `--as-of` is honoured; no comparator may call the wall clock directly — all time comes from `as_of`. Without this, no SELF-VERIFY in this file is reproducible.
3. Exit codes are exactly `0`, `2`, `3` as §0.5 specifies.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli list; echo "exit=$?"; grep -rn "datetime.now\|date.today" reconciler/comparators/ | wc -l
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
exit=0
0
```

**STOP** — if a comparator you write later needs the wall clock rather than `--as-of`, stop and file the blocker: a non-deterministic comparator cannot be accepted by any command in this file.

### L3-P1-02 — Comparator: `people.yaml` vs organisation membership

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 1 (*"Alert; block on removal drift"*); §11.2; §12.2

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/org_membership.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_org_membership.py`

Rule, exactly: for each person in `people.yaml`, compare `access_status`/`availability` against `org_members()`. A person whose `access_status` is `revoked` or whose `availability` is `departed`, **and who is still an organisation member**, is *removal drift*: emit `DriftClass.BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`. A person `active` and absent from the organisation is `AMBER`, `Level.WARN`. `compared` = number of people rows examined.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-02-org-membership
# write the two files
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only org_membership --summary
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_org_membership.py -q
git add reconciler/comparators/org_membership.py reconciler/tests/test_org_membership.py
git commit -m "L3-P1-02: org membership comparator"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p1-02-org-membership
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-02: org membership comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-02."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `dev-2`, class `BLOCKING` (declared `departed`/`revoked`, still an organisation member).
2. `compared` equals 5 (all people rows), satisfying the §53.1 per-registry comparison-count rule.
3. The comparator emits findings only; it revokes nothing.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only org_membership --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK org_membership findings=1 compared=5
CANARY missing
exit=2
```

**STOP** — if `exit` is `0`, the Blocking class is not reaching the exit code; if `findings` is not `1`, `fixture-a` has been altered. Either way, file the blocker.

### L3-P1-03 — Comparator: capabilities vs team-implied authority

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 2 (*"Alert"*); §11.2

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/capability_authority.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_capability_authority.py`

Rule, exactly: Team membership implies Write (§11.2). For each person, if they appear in any product Team but hold no capability in `people.yaml` implying that authority (`code-review`, `verification`, `devops`, `platform-admin`, `escalation`), emit `AMBER`, `Level.WARN`. `compared` = number of people rows.

Follow the same branch/commit/push/PR sequence as L3-P1-02, with branch `lane/3/p1-03-capability-authority`.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-03-capability-authority
# write: reconciler/comparators/capability_authority.py, reconciler/tests/test_capability_authority.py
git add reconciler/comparators/capability_authority.py reconciler/tests/test_capability_authority.py
git commit -m "L3-P1-03: capability vs team-implied authority comparator"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration && git push -u origin lane/3/p1-03-capability-authority
gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-03: capability vs team-implied authority comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-03."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `dev-2` (in team alpha, capabilities empty).
2. Class is `AMBER`, not `BLOCKING` — §53.1 row 2 says *Alert*, and inventing a stricter class than the table states is a spec violation.
3. `compared` equals 5.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only capability_authority --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK capability_authority findings=1 compared=5
CANARY missing
exit=0
```

**STOP** — if you believe this row should be Blocking, stop and file the blocker for L0. §53.4: class assignment *"lives in configuration and is reviewable; it is not decided ad hoc during an incident."*

### L3-P1-04 — Comparator: `product.yaml` assignments vs GitHub Team membership

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 3 (*"Fail CI on the affected repository"*); §11.2

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/team_membership.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_team_membership.py`

Rule, exactly: for each product, the declared Team is the set of logins holding any current assignment in that product's `assignments` block, plus any unexpired `temporary_assignments`. Any actual Team member outside that set, or any declared holder missing from the Team, is `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`. `compared` = number of products.

Branch `lane/3/p1-04-team-membership`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-04-team-membership
# write: reconciler/comparators/team_membership.py, reconciler/tests/test_team_membership.py

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-04: product.yaml assignments vs GitHub Team membership comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-04."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: team `alpha` contains `dev-2`, who holds no assignment.
2. `compared` equals 2.
3. Class is `BLOCKING` — §53.1 row 3 fails CI on the affected repository.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only team_membership --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK team_membership findings=1 compared=2
CANARY missing
exit=2
```

**STOP** — if a fix seems to require removing `dev-2` from the Team, stop: that is a Level-3 repair and Phase 6 has not started. Detect only (§98.2 Phase 3).

---

### L3-P1-05 — Comparator: assignments vs CODEOWNERS

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 4 (*"Regenerate; alert if hand-edited"*); §11.3 (*"human identities only"*); §37.3

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/codeowners.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_codeowners.py`

Rule, exactly: emit at most one finding per `(repo, reason)`. Reason `machine_identity_present` — any owner entry that is a machine identity (a login ending `[bot]`, or a login absent from `people.yaml`) — class `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`, because CODEOWNERS is half the machine-authority wall (§37.3, §11.3). Reason `hand_edited` — actual content differs from the content generated from assignments — class `AMBER`, `Level.WARN`. `compared` = number of repositories.

Branch `lane/3/p1-05-codeowners`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-05-codeowners
# write: reconciler/comparators/codeowners.py, reconciler/tests/test_codeowners.py

git commit -m "L3-P1-05: assignments vs CODEOWNERS comparator"

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-05: assignments vs CODEOWNERS comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-05."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly two findings: `alpha` → `machine_identity_present` (`@ci-bot`), `beta` → `hand_edited`.
2. `compared` equals 2.
3. The comparator regenerates nothing in this phase.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only codeowners --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK codeowners findings=2 compared=2
CANARY missing
exit=2
```

**STOP** — if a machine identity in CODEOWNERS is classified below Blocking, stop: §11.3 makes human-only CODEOWNERS the mechanism preventing a machine approval from satisfying a gate. File the blocker.

---

### L3-P1-06 — Comparator: branch-protection template vs actual

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 5 (*"Alert immediately; block deployment on the affected repository"*); §11.3; §53.3; §53.4

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/branch_protection.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_branch_protection.py`

Rule, exactly: deep-compare actual protection against `declared/templates/branch-protection.json`. Any difference that **weakens** a control (a `true` becoming `false`, a required count decreasing, a required context disappearing) is `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`. Any difference making actual **stricter** than declared is `AMBER`, `Level.WARN`, and is never repaired — §53.3: *"Where actual state is stricter than declared state, reconciliation raises Level 2 for human judgment rather than relaxing the control."* Apply `security_floor()`. `compared` = number of repositories.

Branch `lane/3/p1-06-branch-protection`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-06-branch-protection
# write: reconciler/comparators/branch_protection.py, reconciler/tests/test_branch_protection.py

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-06: branch-protection template vs actual comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-06."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `beta` has `require_code_owner_reviews: false` against a template requiring `true`.
2. Class is `BLOCKING`.
3. A unit test proves the stricter-than-declared direction yields `AMBER` and never a repair proposal (AT-033).

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only branch_protection --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK branch_protection findings=1 compared=2
CANARY missing
exit=2
```

**STOP** — if the stricter-direction test cannot be written because the comparator has no notion of direction, stop and file the blocker: direction is the whole of §53.3, and Phase 6 depends on it.

### L3-P1-07 — Comparator: workflow template version vs actual workflow file

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 6 (*"Alert; flag `platform_compatibility` as drifted"*); §33.2

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/workflow_version.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_workflow_version.py`

Rule, exactly: for each repository, compare each workflow file's `uses_tag` against the product's declared `workflow_tag`. A mismatch is `AMBER`, `Level.WARN`, and the finding's `evidence` must contain the literal token `platform_compatibility=drifted`. `compared` = number of repositories.

Branch `lane/3/p1-07-workflow-version`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-07-workflow-version

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-07: workflow template version vs actual comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-07."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `beta` uses `workflows/v2` against declared `workflows/v3`.
2. The finding's evidence contains `platform_compatibility=drifted`.
3. `compared` equals 2.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only workflow_version --summary; echo "exit=$?"
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only workflow_version --format json | grep -c 'platform_compatibility=drifted'
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK workflow_version findings=1 compared=2
CANARY missing
exit=0
1
```

**STOP** — none beyond the standing rule of §0.6.

### L3-P1-08 — Comparator: environments and deployment branch/tag policy

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 rows 7 and 8; §33.4; §40.3

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/environments.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_environments.py`

Rule, exactly: for each repository and each declared environment, compare against `declared/templates/environment.json`. A missing environment is `AMBER`, `Level.WARN` (row 7). A missing, null or widened **deployment branch and tag policy** on `staging` or `production` is `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK` (row 8) — §33.4 and §40.3 make it the control that makes *"accessible only to the production deployment workflow"* true. `compared` = repositories × declared environments.

Branch `lane/3/p1-08-environments`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-08-environments
# write: reconciler/comparators/environments.py, reconciler/tests/test_environments.py

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-08: environments and deployment branch/tag policy comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-08."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `beta`/`production` has `deployment_branch_policy: null`.
2. Class is `BLOCKING`.
3. `compared` equals 4.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only environments --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK environments findings=1 compared=4
CANARY missing
exit=2
```

**STOP** — if `compared` is 2 rather than 4, the comparator is counting repositories instead of environment rows; §53.1's per-registry counts exist so that *"a silently narrowed comparison is itself visible drift."* Fix the count, do not adjust the expectation.

---

### L3-P1-09 — Comparator: assignment `end_date` vs current Team membership

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 11 (*"Auto-revoke expired access"*); §10.1; §101 invariant 58; AT-008; AT-018

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/expiry.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_expiry.py`

Rule, exactly: for each `temporary_assignments` entry, if `end_date < as_of` and the holder is still in the product Team, emit `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`, recording `repair_class="expiry_revoke"` on the finding for Phase 6 to consume. Additionally emit an `AMBER`, `Level.WARN` finding for any delegation-type assignment within 14 days of expiry — §10.1: *"Delegation expiry is warned, never silent."* `compared` = number of temporary and delegation assignment rows.

Branch `lane/3/p1-09-expiry`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-09-expiry
# write: reconciler/comparators/expiry.py, reconciler/tests/test_expiry.py

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-09: assignment end_date vs current Team membership comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-09."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a` with `--as-of 2026-08-27`, exactly one finding: `dev-1`'s `temporary_contributor` on `alpha`, `end_date 2026-01-31`, still in the Team.
2. `compared` equals 1.
3. **This task revokes nothing.** The `repair_class` tag is metadata; the revocation lands in L3-P6-06.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --as-of 2026-08-27 --only expiry --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK expiry findings=1 compared=1
CANARY missing
exit=2
```

**STOP** — if you are tempted to revoke here because §53.1 says *"Auto-revoke"*, stop. §98.2 Phase 3 says auto-repair is not built in this phase, and §99.4 item 6 defers it until detection has run clean for weeks. Detect now, revoke in Phase 6.

### L3-P1-10 — Comparator: `platform.yaml` workflow tag → resolved SHA

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 13 (*"Blocking on any change — a moved tag reaches every consumer with no reviewable diff"*); §33.2

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/workflow_tag_sha.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_workflow_tag_sha.py`

Rule, exactly: for each tag in `platform.yaml.workflow_tags`, compare the declared `sha` against `resolve_tag(tag)`. Any difference is `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`. There is no Amber form of this row. `compared` = number of declared tags.

Branch `lane/3/p1-10-workflow-tag-sha`; same git sequence.

gh pr create --base integration --title "L3-P1-10: platform.yaml workflow tag to resolved SHA comparator" --body "Lane 3 task L3-P1-10."
```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `workflows/v3` declared `aaaa…`, resolving to `bbbb…`.
2. Class is `BLOCKING`, with no gradation by magnitude.
3. `compared` equals 1.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only workflow_tag_sha --summary; echo "exit=$?"

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK workflow_tag_sha findings=1 compared=1
CANARY missing
exit=2

**STOP** — none beyond the standing rule of §0.6.

### L3-P1-11 — Comparator: Renovate bypass ruleset split

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 14 (*"Blocking where that ruleset names any bypass actor"*); §33.2; D89

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/renovate_bypass.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_renovate_bypass.py`

Rule, exactly: identify the ruleset carrying the `renovate-path-guard` required status check (ruleset B). If its `bypass_actors` list is non-empty, emit `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK` — D89: *"a bypass actor is exempt from every rule in the ruleset it is listed on, so a compensator sitting inside the bypassed ruleset compensates for nothing."* Ruleset A, carrying the pull-request rules, may list the Renovate app and is not a finding. `compared` = number of rulesets examined.

Branch `lane/3/p1-11-renovate-bypass`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-11-renovate-bypass

```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `renovate-B` lists `renovate[bot]`.
2. `renovate-A` produces no finding.
3. `compared` equals 2.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only renovate_bypass --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK renovate_bypass findings=1 compared=2
CANARY missing
exit=2
```

**STOP** — if both rulesets produce findings, the comparator is not distinguishing the pull-request ruleset from the compensating-check ruleset. Fix the comparator; do not change the fixture.

### L3-P1-12 — Comparator: machine workflow-file change and bypass-branch authorship

**Phase** 1 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 (both unnumbered paragraphs); §33.2; §40.3

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/machine_authorship.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_machine_authorship.py`

Rule, exactly — two checks in one comparator:

* **A.** Any workflow file whose last push carries `pusher_is_machine: true` is `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`, *"regardless of the change's content: workflow files define the enforcement path itself, and no machine credential is authorised to alter it"* (§53.1).
* **B.** For each bypass branch, any commit author other than the branch's `declared_bypass_actor` is `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK` — *"a bypass is a grant to one identity, and a branch merging under it must carry that identity's work only"* (§53.1, §33.2).

`compared` = number of workflow files examined plus number of bypass branches examined.

Branch `lane/3/p1-12-machine-authorship`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration && git checkout -b lane/3/p1-12-machine-authorship

```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly two findings: `alpha/ci.yml` pushed by `ci-bot[bot]`; branch `renovate/dep-1` carries a commit by `dev-1`.
2. Both are `BLOCKING`.
3. `compared` equals 2 (one workflow-file row plus one bypass-branch row).

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --only machine_authorship --summary; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
OK machine_authorship findings=2 compared=2

exit=2
```

**STOP** — if check B is implemented as a warning because "the lockfile-only diff is harmless", stop: §33.2 states *"The authorship half is not optional."* File the blocker rather than downgrading.

### L3-P1-13 — Comparator: declared infrastructure boundary vs attestation window

**Phase** 1 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §53.1 row 9 (*"Blocking past its attestation window"*); §40.2

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/infra_attestation.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_infra_attestation.py`

Rule, exactly: for each product declaring an `infrastructure:` block, if `as_of - attestation_date > platform.yaml.attestation_window_days`, emit `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`. §40.2: the provider side is verified *"by attestation rather than reconciliation"* — this comparator checks the attestation's freshness and never contacts the provider. `compared` = number of products declaring the block.

Branch `lane/3/p1-13-infra-attestation`; same git sequence.

**Commands**

### L3-P1-14 — Comparator: record-store write freshness

Past the interval the class is `AMBER` — except for `events/`, `records/deployments/` and `records/uat/`, which are `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK` (§53.1, §97.2). `compared` = number of stores declared.

### L3-P1-16 — Per-registry comparison counts on the run record

**Phase** 1 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P1-02 … L3-P1-15 · **Spec** §53.1 (*"Every run additionally records its per-registry comparison counts … so that a silently narrowed comparison is itself visible drift"*)

**Files (edit):** `reconciler/runrecord.py` · **Files (create):** `reconciler/tests/test_counts.py`

Aggregate every comparator's `compared` value into `comparison_counts`, keyed by comparator id. Add `EXPECTED_MINIMUM_COUNTS` in `reconciler/runrecord.py` holding the nineteen values per FD-061 (L3-01 authoritative; was fourteen). <!-- 19 per FD-061. The fourteen entries from L3-P1-02 … L3-P1-15 are: --> `org_membership=5`, `capability_authority=5`, `team_membership=2`, `codeowners=2`, `branch_protection=2`, `workflow_version=2`, `environments=4`, `expiry=1`, `workflow_tag_sha=1`, `renovate_bypass=2`, `machine_authorship=2`, `infra_attestation=2`, `write_freshness=3`, `restore_tested=2`<!-- ; plus display_name=1 (L3-P1-17), checkrun_identity=2 (L3-P3-03), and three additional comparators per L3-01 CMP-15..CMP-19 reconciliation — values TBD when L3-01 and L3-06 plans are merged. -->.

```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A full `fixture-a` run records all nineteen counts. <!-- 19 per FD-061 (L3-01 authoritative); was fourteen -->
2. Artificially lowering one comparator's count in a test flips `status` to `FAILED` — a narrowed comparison is drift, not silence.
3. The expected-minimum table lives in code and is asserted by test, not written as a comment.

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m pytest reconciler/tests/test_counts.py -q && python -m reconciler.cli run --fixture fixture-a --as-of 2026-08-27 --format json | python -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('counts', len(d['comparison_counts']))"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```

<!-- 19 per FD-061 (L3-01 authoritative); was counts 14. The full 19 requires tasks through L3-P1-17, L3-P3-03, and three additional comparators per L3-01 reconciliation. -->

**Files (create):** `reconciler/canary.py`, `reconciler/comparators/display_name.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_canary.py`

Implement the `display_name` comparator (Green class, §53.2 Level 1) reading `canary.yaml` and reporting the seeded mismatch. Implement `canary.py` with `assert_canary(findings) -> bool`, true only when a finding whose `id` equals the canary's `id` is present. Wire the run so that:

* the canary finding is **never** counted toward any drift budget and is **never** repairable;
* a run whose findings list is empty, **or which does not contain the canary**, sets `status="FAILED"` and exits `3`. AT-102: *"a reconciler that finds nothing is assumed broken, never assumed clean."*

```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A normal `fixture-a` run prints `CANARY found`.
2. A test suppressing the canary produces `status=FAILED` and exit code `3`, **even though other findings exist**.
3. A test suppressing all findings produces `status=FAILED` and exit code `3`.

**Files (create):** `reconciler/annotations.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_annotations.py`

Implement: `annotate_external_cause(run, outage_ref)` setting `run.external_cause`, naming the outage, suppressing raw Red escalation for that run, and marking it for re-execution once the dependency recovers; `acknowledge(finding, by, at)` writing `acknowledged_by`/`acknowledged_at` and refusing to overwrite an existing acknowledgement, so a second responder sees the interrupt is already claimed; `record_clean(run)` producing a full run record for a run with no findings beyond the canary.

```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. An `external-cause` run names the outage and is marked for re-execution.
2. A second `acknowledge()` on an already-claimed finding raises rather than overwrites.

**Files (create):** `reconciler/failmode.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_failmode.py`

Implement `FAIL_MODE: dict[DriftClass, str]` = `{BLOCKING: "closed", RED: "closed", AMBER: "open_with_alert", GREEN: "open_with_alert"}`, and `on_comparator_error(comparator_id, drift_class, exc)`: for a fail-closed class, a comparator's inability to execute is itself a `BLOCKING` finding (§64.2: *"Detection failure must not silently permit drift"*); for a fail-open class, emit an `AMBER` finding naming the alert path and continue. Every comparator must declare its class in the registry; an undeclared comparator fails (§64.2: *"Unclassified controls fail CI"*; §101 invariant 80).

```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A comparator raising an exception in a fail-closed class yields a `BLOCKING` finding, never a silent skip.
2. A comparator with no declared class makes `python -m reconciler.cli list` exit non-zero.

**Files (create):** `reconciler/signals.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_signals.py`

Implement `emit_signals(run) -> list[dict]` producing a SIG-13 entry when `run.status == "FAILED"`, and a further SIG-13 entry for any finding older than the §53.4 response time of its class (`RED` → 2 business days, `BLOCKING` → immediate).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A `FAILED` run emits exactly one SIG-13 for the failure itself.
2. An overdue `RED` finding emits a SIG-13 carrying its age in the evidence.
3. No notification, webhook or message is sent from this lane.

## 5. Phase 2 — Orphan detection at blocking severity

§98.2 Phase 3 ships *"orphan detection at blocking severity"* alongside the detect-only reconciler. The catalogue is the sixteen-row table in §12.2; transcribe it, do not summarise it.

> **DECISION REQUIRED — L3-D4: drift class for orphan severities `High` and `Medium`**
> **Question.** §12.2 grades the sixteen orphan types `Blocking`, `High` and `Medium`. §53.4 states there is exactly one drift severity scale — Green / Amber / Red / Blocking — and retires older vocabulary *"exactly once, here"*, a paragraph that does not cover `High` or `Medium`. §52.2 fixes SIG-05 (orphan risk) at `Blocking`. The mapping for `High` and `Medium` is therefore undefined and must not be guessed.
> **Why L0.** §53.4: *"Class assignment lives in configuration and is reviewable; it is not decided ad hoc."*
> **Interim behaviour, binding until L0 answers:** every orphan finding carries `orphan_severity` transcribed verbatim from §12.2. Findings whose `orphan_severity` is `Blocking` also carry `drift_class=BLOCKING`. Findings graded `High` or `Medium` carry `drift_class=None`, are reported, and are **excluded from every drift-budget count** until L0 answers — the D77 arming discipline applied to a class with no declared home.
> **Blocks:** nothing. Every count in Phase 2 below holds either way.

### L3-P2-01 — Orphan framework and the sixteen-type severity map

**Phase** 2 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-01 · **Spec** §12.2 (the sixteen-row orphan table); §52.2 SIG-05; §101 invariant 57

**Files (create):** `reconciler/orphans/__init__.py`, `reconciler/orphans/types.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_orphan_types.py`

Write `types.py` containing `ORPHAN_TYPES`: an ordered list of exactly sixteen entries, each a frozen dataclass with `index` (1–16), `name`, `detection_source` and `orphan_severity`, transcribed **verbatim** from the §12.2 table in the order printed there:

| # | name | detection_source | orphan_severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Product with no Primary Owner | Assignment registry | Blocking |
| 2 | Product with no Cross-Reviewer | Assignment registry | Blocking |
| 3 | Product with no Backup Owner | Assignment registry | High |
| 4 | Product with no Primary Responder | Contract operations block | Blocking |
| 5 | Shared service with no owner | Service registry | Blocking |
| 6 | Certificate with no owner | Asset inventory | High |
| 7 | Domain with no owner | Asset inventory | Blocking |
| 8 | Vendor relationship with no owner | Asset inventory | Medium |
| 9 | Operational asset with no owner | Asset inventory | Medium |
| 10 | Customer commitment with no owner | Contract operations block | Blocking |
| 11 | Platform migration with no owner | Compatibility state | High |
| 12 | Verification responsibility unassigned | Assignment registry | High |
| 13 | In-flight H1 work with no assignee | Board | High |
| 14 | Temporary person expired with open gate-relevant work | Assignment registry + open reviews and gate items at expiry | High |
| 15 | Policy with no owner | Policy register | Blocking |
| 16 | Open exception whose requester or authority has departed | Exception registry | High |

Groups, used by `--group`: `ownership` = 1–5, `assets` = 6–10, `governance` = 11–16.

Tests assert: exactly sixteen entries; the six `Blocking` rows are exactly indices 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15 — count them: seven; the three groups partition 1–16 with no overlap and no gap.

```

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `len(ORPHAN_TYPES) == 16`.
2. Exactly seven entries carry `orphan_severity == "Blocking"` (indices 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15).
3. Names are transcribed verbatim; no row is reworded, merged or renumbered.

```

Expected output, exactly:

```
3 passed
types 16 blocking 7

**STOP** — if your count of `Blocking` rows is not 7, re-read §12.2 rather than adjusting the code. If §12.2 genuinely disagrees with the seven indices above, file the blocker quoting the table.

### L3-P2-02 — Orphan detectors 1–5 (ownership slots and shared services)

**Phase** 2 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P2-01 · **Spec** §12.2 rows 1–5; §52.2 SIG-05; §101 invariant 7

**Files (create):** `reconciler/orphans/ownership.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_orphan_ownership.py`

Rule, exactly: a slot is orphaned when it is empty **or** held by a person whose `availability` is `departed` or whose `access_status` is `revoked`. `availability: departing` is **not** yet an orphan — it is the trigger for prospective mode (L3-P2-05). `compared` = number of products plus number of shared services.

<!-- BLOCKED pending DR-L3-05-A through E Founder decisions: fixture-a people.yaml (File 1) is a CONTESTED(DR-L3-05-A) placeholder. Counts below assume the placeholder values and will change when DR-L3-05-A is resolved. -->

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly four findings: `beta` no Cross-Reviewer (type 2), `beta` no Backup Owner (type 3), `beta` no Primary Responder (type 4), `auth-service` no owner (type 5).
2. `alpha` produces no ownership orphan, and `beta`'s Primary Owner (`dev-1`) produces none.
3. `compared` equals 3.

### L3-P2-03 — Orphan detectors 6–10 (assets and customer commitments)

**Phase** 2 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P2-01 · **Spec** §12.2 rows 6–10; §49.1 (*"Asset owners participate in orphan detection"*); §21.1

Rule, exactly: an asset row (`certificate`, `domain`, `vendor`, `operational`) with an empty `owner`, or an owner who is `departed`/`revoked`, is an orphan of the matching type. A `commitments` entry with an empty `owner` is type 10. `compared` = number of asset rows plus number of commitment rows.

<!-- BLOCKED pending DR-L3-05-A through E Founder decisions: fixture-a assets.yaml (File 6) is a CONTESTED(DR-L3-05-A) placeholder and alpha.yaml COM-alpha-001 (File 2) is a CONTESTED(DR-L3-05-E) placeholder.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly three findings: `domain-1` (type 7, Blocking), `vendor-1` (type 8, Medium), `COM-alpha-001` (type 10, Blocking).
2. `cert-1` produces **no** finding: its owner `qa-1` is `departing`, which is still active.

### L3-P2-04 — Orphan detectors 11–16 (migration, verification, H1, temporary expiry, policy, exception)

**Phase** 2 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P2-01 · **Spec** §12.2 rows 11–16; §12.2 (*"Temporary-person expiry is an exit"*); §54; §55

**Files (create):** `reconciler/orphans/governance.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_orphan_governance.py`

Rule, exactly, one detector per type: migration with empty `owner`; product with empty `verification_responsibility`; board item at `horizon: H1` with empty `assignee`; an expired temporary assignment whose holder still appears in `open_gate_items` (type 14 — §12.2 names this *"the fourteenth orphan type"*); policy with empty `owner`; open exception whose `requester` or `authority` is `departed`. `compared` = 6, one per type examined.

<!-- BLOCKED pending DR-L3-05-A through E Founder decisions: fixture-a board.yaml (File 10) is CONTESTED(DR-L3-05-C) and CONTESTED(DR-L3-05-D) placeholders. WI-101 (H1 assignee, type 13) and REV-9 (open gate item, type 14) reference pre-decided fields that are pending DR-L3-05-C and DR-L3-05-D Founder decisions. Finding counts below will change when those decisions are resolved. -->

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a` with `--as-of 2026-08-27`, exactly five findings: `beta` verification unassigned (12), `WI-101` H1 unassigned (13), `dev-1` expired temporary holding open `REV-9` (14), `POL-001` no owner (15), `EXC-001` requester `dev-2` departed (16).
2. `MIG-1` produces no finding — it has owner `lead-1` (type 11 clean).
3. `compared` equals 6.

### L3-P2-05 — Prospective orphan mode on `availability: departing`

**Phase** 2 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P2-02, L3-P2-03, L3-P2-04 · **Spec** §12.2 (*"Orphan detection runs immediately when `availability` becomes `departing`, in prospective mode against the declared `end_date`: it emits the transfer worklist"*); AT-017

**Files (create):** `reconciler/orphans/prospective.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_orphan_prospective.py`

Rule, exactly: for each person whose `availability` is `departing`, re-run every detector with that person treated as inactive **as of their `end_date`**, and emit the resulting findings as a **transfer worklist**, each carrying `prospective=True` and `orphans_on=<end_date>`. Prospective findings never enter drift-budget counts and never block; they are a generated worklist for the knowledge-transfer window. `compared` = number of people rows examined.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a` with `--prospective --as-of 2026-08-27`, exactly two findings, both `prospective=True` and both `orphans_on=2026-09-30`: `alpha` verification responsibility (type 12) and `cert-1` (type 6), both held by `qa-1`.
2. No prospective finding sets exit code `2` — the run's exit code is `0` when only prospective findings exist.
3. `compared` equals 5.

### L3-P2-06 — Blocking orphans are non-dismissible; SIG-05 emission

**Phase** 2 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P2-05 · **Spec** §12.2 (*"Blocking orphans … cannot be dismissed without resolution"*); §101 invariant 57; §52.2 SIG-05 (Blocking, owner Team Lead)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/orphans/dismissal.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_orphan_dismissal.py`

Implement `dismiss(finding, actor, reason)` which **raises** `NonDismissibleOrphan` for any finding whose `orphan_severity` is `Blocking`, regardless of actor or reason, and permits dismissal only with a linked resolution reference for other severities. Extend `emit_signals()` to raise SIG-05 with `drift_class="Blocking"` and `owner="team_lead"` when any product's Primary Owner, Cross-Reviewer or named responder slot is orphaned — transcribed from the §52.2 SIG-05 row and its disjointness note (*"Orphan risk (SIG-05) is a product-structure condition"*).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `dismiss()` raises on every `Blocking` orphan, including when the actor holds `platform-admin`.
2. SIG-05 fires for `beta` on `fixture-a` and does not fire for `alpha`.
3. SIG-05 is not conflated with SIG-26 or SIG-27 — a test asserts only SIG-05 is emitted for a product-structure orphan (§52.2 disjoint definitions).

## 6. Phase 3 — The Level 4 block surface

This phase turns findings into the one thing that stops work: the `control-plane/blocking-drift` required status check named in §11.3.

### L3-P3-01 — Drift-class configuration loader from `os-health.yaml`

**Phase** 3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-19 · **Spec** §53.4 (*"Class assignment lives in configuration and is reviewable"*); §52.2; §53.6

**Files (create):** `reconciler/driftclass.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_driftclass.py`

Implement `load_classes(os_health_path) -> dict[str, DriftClass]` mapping comparator id → configured class, with the code's own default used only where the file declares none, and `security_floor()` applied last so that *"Security drift and production environment drift are never classified below Red"* (§53.4) cannot be configured away. `os-health.yaml` lives in `registries/**` and is owned by Lane 1: **read it, never write it.**

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A configured class overrides the code default for a non-security comparator.
2. A configuration attempting to set a security or production-environment comparator below `RED` is refused, and the refusal is itself a finding.
3. No write occurs to `registries/**` or any file outside the three owned roots.

### L3-P3-02 — `control-plane/blocking-drift` check-run publisher

**Phase** 3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P3-01 · **Spec** §11.3 (the required status check *"the reconciler holds at failure while Blocking-class drift is open against the product"*); §40.1 (*"the reconciler credential additionally holds check-run write on product repositories, used for exactly one named check"*); §53.2 Level 4

**Files (create):** `reconciler/checkrun.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_checkrun.py`

Implement `publish(repo, findings, dry_run=True)` producing a check run named **exactly** `control-plane/blocking-drift` with conclusion `failure` while any Blocking-class finding is open against that product, and `success` otherwise. Constraints, enforced in code and by test:

* The publisher may emit **only** that one check name. Any other name raises.
* A check run carries status only: it writes no repository content, approves nothing, and satisfies no gate a human is required to satisfy (§40.1).
* `dry_run=True` is the default; the live path is reached only with an explicit flag.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Publishing under any name other than `control-plane/blocking-drift` raises.
2. With one Blocking finding against `beta`, the conclusion is `failure`; with none, `success`.
3. The module contains no call that writes repository content, secrets, environments or workflow files (safety rule 4).

### L3-P3-03 — Check-run identity assertion

**Phase** 3 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P3-02 · **Spec** §40.1 (*"A check run published under that name by any identity other than the reconciler is Blocking drift"*)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/comparators/checkrun_identity.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_checkrun_identity.py`

Rule, exactly: for each repository, read `check_runs(repo)`; if `control-plane/blocking-drift` exists and `published_by` is not the declared reconciler identity, emit `BLOCKING`, `Level.BLOCK`. `compared` = number of repositories.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, exactly one finding: `alpha`'s check published by `other-bot`.
2. `beta`'s check, published by `reconciler`, produces no finding.

### L3-P3-04 — Drift budget counters

**Phase** 3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P3-01 · **Spec** §53.4 budget rules (Amber up to 2 per product; Red flat 3 portfolio-wide; Green unlimited; Blocking has no budget)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/budget.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_budget.py`

Implement `evaluate(findings, product_count, config)` returning per-class open counts, ceilings and breach flags. Rules, transcribed:

* **Amber ceiling = `amber_per_product` × product_count.** It scales with the portfolio *"because Amber is routine remediation debt and a fixed ceiling would tighten silently as products are added"*.
* **Red ceiling = `red_portfolio_flat`, and does not scale**, *"because Red is the volume of material unremediated risk the team can actually hold in attention at once; that number is a property of the team, not of the portfolio."*
* **Green unlimited. Blocking has no budget.**
* Exceeding the Amber tolerance emits an Amber signal **about the operating system**, not about any product (§53.4).
* Canary findings and prospective orphan findings are excluded from all counts.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. With `amber_per_product: 2` and 2 products, the Amber ceiling computes as 4; with 8 products, 16; with 20 products, 40 (the three figures §53.4 states).
2. The Red ceiling stays 3 at every product count.
3. An Amber breach is attributed to the operating system, not to a product.

**STOP** — if the Red ceiling is made to scale with product count, stop: §53.4 makes the non-scaling deliberate (*"A growing portfolio therefore makes the Red budget bind harder, and that is the intended pressure"*).

### L3-P3-05 — Reclassification gate

**Phase** 3 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P3-01 · **Spec** §53.5 (*"Reclassifying a finding downward requires the same authority as approving an exception for it, and is recorded as a decision. There is no informal path from Red to Amber."*)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/reclassify.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_reclassify.py`

Implement `reclassify(finding, to_class, actor, decision_record_id)`. Downward reclassification (`BLOCKING`→lower, `RED`→lower, `AMBER`→`GREEN`) **raises** unless a non-empty `decision_record_id` is supplied and the actor holds exception-approval authority per the §54.3 authority mapping. Upward reclassification is always permitted and recorded. Every reclassification writes an audit entry; none is silent.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Downward reclassification without a decision-record id raises.
2. Downward reclassification by an actor lacking exception authority raises even with an id.
3. Upward reclassification succeeds and is recorded.

**Phase** 3 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P3-04 · **Spec** §53.6 (*"a finding closed without evidence of remediation, or a finding that recurs in the same scope shortly after closure, is reopened and counted as a closure-quality defect, not as new drift"*)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/closure_audit.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_closure_audit.py`

Implement `audit(closed_findings, open_findings, recurrence_window_days)` returning: closures with no linked remediation evidence, and findings recurring in the same `scope` inside the recurrence window. Both are **reopened** and tagged `closure_quality_defect=True` so they are not double-counted as new drift.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A closure with no evidence link is reopened and tagged.
2. A same-scope recurrence inside the window is reopened and tagged, and does not increment the new-drift count.
3. `recurrence_window_days` is configuration, not a literal in the algorithm (§53.6: tolerances are calibration-reviewed).

## 7. Phase 4 — Provisioning and scaffolding v0

§98.2 Phase 3 ships *"Scaffolding v0 — `create-product` and `add-person`, generating repository, Teams, CODEOWNERS, branch protection and registry entries with zero hand-editing"*. §12.6: *"No ordinary personnel or product change should require hand-editing files across twenty repositories. If it does, the scaffolding is incomplete and that is a platform defect."*

**Dry-run summary format, used by every operation in this phase:**

```
PLAN <operation> steps=<int> writes=<int> manual=<int>
```

`writes` is the count of mutations actually performed; in `--dry-run` it is always `0`. `manual` is the count of manual-step issues the operation would emit (§19.1: *"where the provider offers no automation, tracked manual steps emitted as issues so neither is silently missing"*).

### L3-P4-01 — `provision` CLI skeleton, dry-run by default

**Phase** 4 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P0-06 · **Spec** §12.6; §64.1 (*"a configuration error must never grant excess authority"*); §101 invariant 79

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/cli.py`, `tools/provision/plan.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_cli.py`

`plan.py`: a `Step` dataclass (`id`, `description`, `kind` ∈ {`write`, `manual`, `read`}) and a `Plan` holding an ordered list of steps with `summary_line(operation)` rendering the format above. `cli.py`: subcommands `create-product`, `add-person`, `change-role`, `remove-person`, each requiring `--fixture` or `--live`, with `--dry-run` **on by default**; performing real writes requires the explicit flag `--apply`.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Omitting `--apply` performs zero writes, for every subcommand.
2. `--apply` without `--live` is refused (you cannot mutate a fixture).
3. Safe defaults are the default: nothing this CLI creates is public, pre-approved, or granted an environment (§64.1).

### L3-P4-02 — CODEOWNERS generator, human identities only

**Phase** 4 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P4-01 · **Spec** §11.3 (*"CODEOWNERS is generated to contain human identities only — no machine account ever appears in it"*); §37.3; §98.2 Phase 1 completion check

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/codeowners.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_codeowners.py`

Implement `generate(product, registries) -> str` producing, in this order and no other: product source paths owned by the product Team; `verification/` owned by the holder of `verification_responsibility`; `product.yaml`, migration directories and CI workflow files owned by the Team Lead role (all four rules transcribed from §11.3). The generator **filters every candidate against `people.yaml`** and raises `MachineIdentityInCodeowners` if any output line names a login absent from `people.yaml` or matching a machine-identity pattern.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Generated output for `alpha` contains no `@ci-bot` and no `[bot]` suffix.

### L3-P4-03 — Branch-protection applier from template

**Phase** 4 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P4-01 · **Spec** §11.3 (the ten-bullet checklist); §98.2 Phase 1 (*"The required-status-check list starts empty per repository"*); §64.1

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/protection.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_protection.py`

Implement `plan_protection(repo, template)` emitting one step per §11.3 bullet: require a pull request; require at least 1 approving review; require review from Code Owners; require approval of the most recent reviewable push; dismiss stale approvals; require status checks to pass; require branches up to date; block force pushes and deletions on the default branch; apply rules to administrators; and apply the environment deployment branch and tag policy. **The `contexts` list is applied empty at creation** and populated only as each check comes into existence — §98.2 Phase 1: *"A required check no workflow emits blocks every pull request indefinitely; a list that silently stays empty is a gate that reads armed and is not."* Emit a `manual` step recording which contexts the repository still owes.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All ten §11.3 bullets appear as steps, in the order printed there.
2. At creation, `required_status_checks.contexts` is empty and a manual step records the owed contexts.
3. No step ever removes or weakens an existing protection setting (safety rule 2).

### L3-P4-04 — Environments and deployment branch/tag policy applier

**Phase** 4 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P4-01 · **Spec** §33.4; §19.1; §64.1 (*"production environment created without secrets and without approvers until explicitly configured"*)

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/environments.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_environments.py`

Implement `plan_environments(repo, template)` creating `development`, `staging` and `production`, applying to `staging` and `production` a deployment branch and tag policy accepting the default branch and protected release tags **and no other ref** (§33.4). The plan **never** creates a secret and never sets an approver — §64.1.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Three environments are planned; `staging` and `production` each carry the branch/tag policy.
2. Zero steps of kind `write` touch a secret (safety rule 2 and AT-110 negative attempt 1).

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/teams.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_teams.py`

Implement `plan_teams(registries)` producing: one Team per product named for the product, containing every holder of a current assignment on it; plus exactly two organisation-wide Teams, one for the Team Lead role and one for the QA role. Membership is **derived**, never passed in by the caller; a caller-supplied member list raises.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, two product Teams (`alpha`, `beta`) and two org-wide Teams are planned.
2. `alpha`'s planned membership is exactly the four current assignment holders — `dev-2` is absent, because it holds no assignment.

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/repo.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_repo.py`

Implement `plan_repo(product)` creating the repository **private**, from `product-template`, with no environment access and no third-party app access (§11.3, §64.1), then asserting the presence of every required file of §33.1: `.env.example`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `Makefile`, seed data, migration directory, `verification/`, `AGENTS.md`, and either `product.yaml` or a pointer to the product it belongs to — eight items — plus the eight local-environment-contract commands (`setup`, `dev`, `test`, `uat-local`, `migrate`, `reset`, `health`, `parity`). A missing item is a hard failure of the plan, not a warning (§33.1: *"Required-file presence is checked, not assumed"*).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. The repository is planned private with no app access and no environment access.
2. All eight required files and all eight commands are asserted.
3. A template missing any one of them fails the plan.

### L3-P4-07 — `create-product` orchestrator

**Phase** 4 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P4-02, L3-P4-03, L3-P4-04, L3-P4-05, L3-P4-06 · **Spec** §19.1 (the CREATE PRODUCT block); §12.6; AT-001

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/create_product.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_create_product.py`

Compose the plan in **exactly** the §19.1 order, thirteen automated steps:

| # | Step id | §19.1 line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `repo_from_template` | repository or repository set from the standard template |
| 2 | `product_yaml` | `product.yaml` at current `contract_version` |
| 3 | `team` | GitHub Team |
| 4 | `codeowners` | CODEOWNERS generated from assignments |
| 5 | `branch_protection` | branch protection from template |
| 6 | `environments` | environments: development, staging, production |
| 7 | `ci_workflows_pinned_tag` | CI workflows consuming reusable workflows by pinned tag |
| 8 | `verification_skeleton` | `verification/` skeleton |
| 9 | `local_environment_contract` | local environment contract — the eight commands |
| 10 | `required_endpoints` | health, version and metrics endpoints |
| 11 | `register_portfolio_board` | registered: portfolio board |
| 12 | `register_grafana_scorecard_devlake` | registered: Grafana · Scorecard · DevLake |
| 13 | `register_dependency_graph` | registered: dependency graph |

Plus **two manual steps**: `alert_channel` and `support_intake_mailbox` — §19.1: *"or, where the provider offers no automation, tracked manual steps emitted as issues so neither is silently missing."*

Steps 11–13 must enumerate from the product registry; a hard-coded product list anywhere in this module fails the task (§101 invariants 52 and 53; AT-001).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `PLAN create-product steps=13 writes=0 manual=2` on a dry run.
2. `grep -rn "alpha\|beta" tools/provision/create_product.py` returns nothing — no product name is hard-coded.
3. Every step id above appears exactly once, in the order listed.

### L3-P4-08 — CONFIGURE checklist and manual-step issue emitter

**Phase** 4 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P4-07 · **Spec** §19.1 (*"the scaffold emits a CONFIGURE checklist issue enumerating every item below"*)

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/checklists.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_checklists.py`

Implement `configure_checklist(product)` rendering an issue body enumerating exactly the §19.1 CONFIGURE items: environments · verification contract · observability · backups · classification · budget band · support intake — seven items, with the budget-band line noting it is *"set by the Founder as a provisional estimate, refined at the first cost review"*. Implement `manual_step_issue(step)` rendering one issue per manual step from L3-P4-07.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. The checklist enumerates exactly seven CONFIGURE items, verbatim.
2. Two manual-step issues are rendered for a `create-product` plan.
3. Nothing is posted to GitHub without `--apply --live`.

### L3-P4-09 — `add-person` orchestrator

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/add_person.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_add_person.py`

Compose the plan in **exactly** the §12.6 order, seven automated steps: `people_yaml_entry`, `org_invitation` (base Read only), `team_membership_per_assignments`, `capability_grants` (explicit, never inherited wholesale — §12.1, §64.1), `ai_runtime_assignment` honouring the product's declared `ai_restrictions` (§36.4), `onboarding_checklist_issue`, `register_review_network_view`. Plus **one manual step**: `self_view_key_exchange` — §12.1: *"the encryption key for their self-view document, handed once, in person."*

The onboarding checklist issue must name the external conduct adviser and the fairness rules (§12.1: *"every joiner learns, in writing and on day one, who the conduct adviser is"*) and render the §12.7 milestone bands.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `PLAN add-person steps=7 writes=0 manual=1` on a dry run.
2. The invitation step grants base Read only; no step grants Write outside Team membership derived from assignments (§11.2).
3. A product declaring `ai_restrictions` constrains the runtime step at onboarding, not later (§36.4).

### L3-P4-10 — Pre-provisioning (T-minus-one-week) checklist emitter

**Phase** 4 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P4-09 · **Spec** §12.1 (*"At one week before the start date the operator works a pre-provisioning checklist"*); §49

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/preprovision.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_preprovision.py`

Implement `preprovision_checklist(login, start_date)` rendering exactly the six §12.1 items: GitHub account confirmed; hardware ready; email account created; AI-runtime choice asked of the joiner; the runtime seat purchased; an asset-inventory entry recorded for issued hardware. The issue is dated `start_date - 7 days`.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Exactly six items, verbatim from §12.1.
2. The due date is exactly seven days before `start_date`.
3. The asset-inventory item names §49 as its destination and is not written by this lane.

## 8. Phase 5 — The independent control verifier and the credential bound

§53.1: *"Reconciliation regenerates CODEOWNERS and re-applies branch protection, and is also the only thing that checks them — an instrument that can rewrite the wall it inspects and then report the wall intact."* This phase builds the second verifier. It is a **separate program under a separate credential**, and Lane 3 builds the program only: Lane 2 schedules it as a workflow in the control-plane repository (§0.4).

**Verifier summary format:**

```
VERIFY <assertion_id> result=<pass|fail> checked=<int>
VERIFIER result=<pass|fail> assertions=<int>
```

### L3-P5-01 — Independent verifier skeleton under a separate credential

**Phase** 5 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P4-02 · **Spec** §53.1 (*"A second verifier therefore runs off the operations VM and under a different credential … holding its own read-only fine-grained credential"*); §37.3

**Files (create):** `validators/drift/__init__.py`, `validators/drift/verifier.py`, `validators/drift/tests/test_verifier.py`

Implement an assertion registry (`@assertion("<id>")`) and a `__main__` entry with `--fixture`, `--only`, `--summary`, `--live`. Hard constraints, enforced by test:

* The verifier **imports nothing from `reconciler/**`**. It must not share code with the instrument it audits — a verifier that reuses the reconciler's comparison logic inherits the reconciler's blind spots.
* It reads a credential from a distinct environment variable, `DRIFT_VERIFIER_TOKEN`, and never from the reconciler's variable.
* It performs no write of any kind. §53.1: *"It writes its result to a surface the operations VM cannot write to"* — that surface is Lane 2's workflow output, not this lane's to create.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `grep -rn "^from reconciler\|^import reconciler" validators/drift/` returns nothing.
2. The verifier reads only `DRIFT_VERIFIER_TOKEN`.
3. With no assertions registered, `--summary` prints `VERIFIER result=pass assertions=0` and exits 0.

**Phase** 5 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P5-01 · **Spec** §53.1 (*"asserting that no machine identity appears in any CODEOWNERS file in any repository"*); §11.3; §37.3

**Files (create):** `validators/drift/assert_codeowners.py`, `validators/drift/tests/test_assert_codeowners.py`

Assertion id `codeowners_human_only`. For every repository, read the actual CODEOWNERS and fail if any owner entry is a machine identity — a login ending `[bot]`, or absent from `people.yaml`. `checked` = number of repositories.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, `result=fail` because `alpha` names `@ci-bot`.
2. `checked` equals 2.
3. The assertion re-reads CODEOWNERS from the actual state; it never compares against the generator's output (that would be the reconciler checking its own wall).

**Files (create):** `validators/drift/assert_protection.py`, `validators/drift/tests/test_assert_protection.py`

Assertion id `protection_matches_template`. Compare actual protection and ruleset JSON against the **committed** template file, byte-normalised, for every repository. Any difference in either direction fails — this assertion is not the reconciler's stricter-only comparison; it asks only whether the wall matches the committed template. `checked` = number of repositories.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, `result=fail` because `beta` has `require_code_owner_reviews: false`.
2. `checked` equals 2.
3. The template is read from the committed file, never from the reconciler's in-memory copy.

Assertion id `bypass_actors_exact`. The declared set, transcribed:

* **Control-plane repository:** the bypass-actor list is **empty**. §40.1: *"No bypass actor exists"*; D89 makes this *"literally true rather than true-by-convention"*.
* **Records repository:** the force-push/deletion ruleset has **no bypass actor** (D107).
* **`workflows/*` tag ruleset:** **empty** bypass-actor list (§33.2).
* **Renovate ruleset A** (pull-request rules): may list the Renovate app and nothing else.
* **Renovate ruleset B** (the `renovate-path-guard` check): **no bypass actor at all** (§33.2, D89).

Any actor outside this set, in either direction, fails. `checked` = number of rulesets examined.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a`, `result=fail` because `renovate-B` lists `renovate[bot]`.
2. `checked` equals 2.
3. The declared set is a literal table in the module, each row citing its spec section — not inferred from the actual state.

### L3-P5-05 — Verifier absence for one cycle is Level 5

**Phase** 5 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P5-01 · **Spec** §53.1 (*"its own absence for one cycle is Level 5"*); §53.2 Level 5; AT-032

The check runs **inside the reconciler's run as well**, so that a dead verifier is visible from both sides; expose it as a plain function that `reconciler/signals.py` may import.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A gap of one cycle plus one minute yields `Level.ESCALATE`.
2. A gap inside one cycle yields no finding.
3. The function has no side effect and issues no notification.

### L3-P5-06 — AT-110 credential-bounds probe: six negative attempts

**Phase** 5 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P3-02 · **Spec** **AT-110** verbatim; §40.1; §99.6 risk 6

L3-P5-06 --mode live is the single credential probe for live system access. `L3-07` T10's `AT-110.sh` is reduced to `GATE.md` + `RESULT.template.md` invoking it.

**Files (create):** `validators/drift/credential_bounds.py`, `validators/drift/tests/test_credential_bounds.py`

AT-110, transcribed: *"From the reconciler's own credential, six attempts are made — a write to a GitHub Actions secret, a write to an environment, a workflow-file change, an organisation-settings change, a `records/**` write, and any Layer B access — and all six fail; the credential then still completes a normal reconciliation run."*

Implement `probe(credential, mode)` performing exactly those six attempts in that order, each returning `blocked` or `PERMITTED`, followed by a normal reconciliation run that must still complete. Two modes: `fixture` (a fixture credential simulating the declared permission set, used by every acceptance command here) and `live` (used only at the phase that builds the reconciler and at every rotation — §40.1: *"After any rotation, a manual reconciliation run must complete clean before the rotation is recorded as done"*).

Any attempt returning `PERMITTED` is a **security incident under §43**, not a test failure: the probe must say so in its output and exit `3`.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All six attempts are present, in AT-110's order, each named in the output.
2. In fixture mode, all six report `blocked` and the follow-on reconciliation run completes.
3. A single `PERMITTED` result exits `3` and prints the §43 escalation line.

**STOP** — if any attempt returns `PERMITTED` in **live** mode, stop everything: open a security incident under §43 before any further Lane 3 work, and file the blocker referencing §99.6 risk 6 (*"the reconciler's own credential in the top secrets tier with its compromise treated as a security incident"*).

### L3-P5-07 — Behavioural-envelope checks

**Phase** 5 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P1-18 · **Spec** §40.1 *"The behavioural envelope"* (all four controls); §40.3

**Files (create):** `reconciler/envelope.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_envelope.py`

Implement the four controls §40.1 names, and only those four:

| Control | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `signed_run_record` | every run names its scheduled trigger; a run with no matching trigger record raises immediately |
| `run_count_ceiling` | calibrated configuration, initial value **twice the scheduled run count per day**, recalibrated whenever the schedule changes |
| `expected_source_host` | a run from any other host is out of envelope |
| `per_run_api_call_counts` | published per run, so read-side abuse surfaces as a volume anomaly |

A run outside the envelope is `BLOCKING` drift. §40.1 explains why time alone is not the boundary: *"an alert that cannot fire is a gate that appears to be working and is not."*

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All four controls exist; a run breaching any one produces a `BLOCKING` finding naming which control.
2. The ceiling is configuration, not a literal, and its initial value is twice the scheduled run count.
3. The API-call count is published on every run, including clean ones.

**Commands**

```bash

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash

```

Expected output, exactly:

```
8 passed
controls 4 ['expected_source_host', 'per_run_api_call_counts', 'run_count_ceiling', 'signed_run_record']
```

**STOP** — if the envelope is reduced to a scheduled-window check, stop: §40.1 rejects that explicitly (*"the complement is nearly empty, an attacker simply acts inside the hour"*).

### L3-P5-08 — Records-repository head SHA anchor

**Phase** 5 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P1-18 · **Spec** §40.1 *"History is anchored where it cannot be rewritten"* (D107); §53.2 Level 5; §101 invariant 47

**Files (create):** `reconciler/anchor.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_anchor.py`

Implement `anchor(records_head_sha, commit_count, previous_anchor)`: once per reconciliation run, record the records repository's default-branch head SHA and commit count. If the new head does **not descend** from the last anchored SHA, that is **Blocking drift at Level 5** — D107: *"a head that does not descend from the last anchored SHA is proof of rewriting rather than evidence of it."*

The anchor value is produced here and handed to the control-plane write path; this lane does **not** write it into `records/**` (that repository is Lane 4's, and the reconciler credential cannot reach it — AT-110 attempt 5).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A descendant head anchors cleanly.
2. A non-descendant head yields `Level.ESCALATE` and `DriftClass.BLOCKING`.
3. The module performs no write to `records/**` or `events/**`.

## 9. Phase 6 — Auto-repair (Level 3), one class at a time

**Do not start this phase until detection has run clean for the period L0 records.** §99.4 item 6: *"Auto-repair is deferred until detection has run clean for weeks; auto-repair is the riskiest code in the system, and its stricter-only rule is enforced in code and tested."* §99.6 risk 6: *"Detect-only first; repair classes enabled one at a time."* Literal detect-clean period: 30 days (as required by REG-027).

Every repair class in this phase is written against the same three-part contract: it consumes a finding produced in Phase 1 or 2, it asks `stricter.py` for permission, and it writes a repair record. No repair class may bypass any of the three.

---

### L3-P6-01 — Stricter-only predicate and its proof suite

**Phase** 6 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P1-19 · **Spec** §53.3 verbatim; §101 invariant 81; **AT-033**

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/__init__.py`, `reconciler/repair/stricter.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_stricter.py`

Implement `permitted(declared, actual, control_kind) -> tuple[bool, str]` returning `(True, "")` only when **both** hold: the repair moves actual toward declared, **and** declared is at least as restrictive as actual. Otherwise return `(False, reason)`. Four absolute refusals, returning `False` unconditionally regardless of direction: production runtime configuration, data, secrets, and any control the repair would loosen (§53.3).

The proof suite is the point of this task. Write at least twelve cases covering: declared stricter and actual loose (permit); declared loose and actual stricter (refuse, and emit Level 2 for human judgment — AT-033); equal (no repair); each of the four absolute refusals; a boolean flag in both directions; a numeric threshold in both directions; a list of required contexts in both directions.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Every one of the twelve cases passes, and the actual-stricter case emits `Level.WARN`, never a repair.
2. The four absolute refusals return `False` even when the direction is toward declared.
3. `permitted()` is the **only** gate: no repair module may write without calling it (asserted in L3-P6-09).

### L3-P6-02 — Repair enablement registry, every class default-off

**Phase** 6 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P6-01 · **Spec** §99.6 risk 6 (*"repair classes enabled one at a time"*); §98.3; §64.1

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/enablement.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_enablement.py`

Implement `REPAIR_CLASSES`: the five §53.2 Level-3 classes, transcribed — `team_sync` (Team membership sync from registries), `codeowners_regen` (CODEOWNERS regeneration), `label_sync` (label and board field sync), `protection_reapply` (re-applying declared branch protection), `expiry_revoke` (removing expired assignments and expired access). Each carries `enabled: False` as its **declared default**, an `enabled_on` date, and an `enabled_by` decision-record id. Enabling requires all three; enabling more than one class in a single change **raises**.

`python -m reconciler.cli repair-classes --summary` prints one line per class: `CLASS <id> enabled=<true|false>`, then `REPAIR_CLASSES total=5 enabled=<int>`.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All five classes exist, and all five default to `enabled=false`.
2. Enabling a class without a decision-record id raises.
3. Enabling two classes in one change raises.

### L3-P6-03 — Repair class: Team membership sync from the registries

**Phase** 6 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P6-02 · **Spec** §53.2 Level 3; §11.2; §26.4 (*"reconciliation Level-3 auto-repairs … write directly under the reconciler credential, logged as repair records"*)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/team_sync.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_repair_team_sync.py`

Consume `team_membership` findings. For each, call `permitted()`; on approval, add missing declared holders and remove members holding no assignment. **Removal is the stricter direction and is permitted; addition of a member is permitted only where the registry declares the assignment.** No membership is ever added from actual state.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. On `fixture-a` with the class enabled, exactly one repair: `dev-2` removed from team `alpha`.
2. With the class disabled (the default), zero repairs and the finding remains open.
3. Every repair calls `permitted()` first; a test asserts the call.

**Phase** 6 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P6-02, L3-P4-02 · **Spec** §53.1 row 4; §53.2 Level 3; §11.3

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/codeowners_regen.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_repair_codeowners.py`

Consume `codeowners` findings. Regenerate through `tools.provision.codeowners.generate` — one generator, never two — and write the result. The generator's machine-identity refusal (L3-P4-02) therefore applies to the repair path too: a regeneration that would emit a machine identity **raises rather than writes**.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Regeneration for `alpha` removes `@ci-bot` and produces a human-only file.
2. A generation attempt that would emit a machine identity raises and writes nothing.
3. The module imports the provisioning generator rather than reimplementing it.

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/protection_reapply.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_repair_protection.py`

Consume `branch_protection` findings. Re-apply the declared template **only** where `permitted()` approves. Where actual is stricter than declared, do nothing and leave the Level 2 finding standing — this is AT-033 in code: *"Reconciliation presented with a stricter-than-declared production control raises it for human review and does not relax it."*

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `beta`'s `require_code_owner_reviews: false` is repaired to `true`.
2. A repository with a stricter-than-declared setting is **not** touched, and its Level 2 finding remains.
3. The required-status-check `contexts` list is never shortened by a repair.

### L3-P6-06 — Repair class: expired assignment and expired access removal

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/expiry_revoke.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_repair_expiry.py`

Consume `expiry` findings and expired exception entries. Remove the expired assignment and revoke the access it conferred, **without human action** — AT-018: *"Reconciliation removes it without human action; access is revoked and capacity recalculated."* AT-036: *"Reconciliation revokes it with no human action."* An exception that cannot be auto-revoked becomes **Blocking drift on its expiry date** (AT-037).

Per §26.4, this class writes directly under the reconciler credential and bypasses the human owner-review lane, *"routing these machine-derived transitions through human reviewers would queue the 'no human action required' expiry guarantees behind the very people they are designed not to need."*

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `dev-1`'s expired `temporary_contributor` on `alpha` is removed and Team access revoked.
2. An exception past expiry that cannot be revoked yields a `BLOCKING` finding rather than a silent skip (AT-037).
3. A temporary assignment never becomes a permanent one through inaction (§10.2).

Consume label and board-field drift findings and sync them to declared state. This is the lowest-risk class in the set and confers no authority; it still goes through `permitted()` and still writes a repair record, because the contract is uniform.

**Acceptance** — all true:

### L3-P6-08 — Repair record emitter

**Phase** 6 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P6-02 · **Spec** §26.4 (*"logged as repair records and visible on the drift view"*); §53.2 Level 3 (*"then record the repair"*); §53.7

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/records.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_repair_records.py`

Emit one repair record per repair, shaped to the `repair_record` contract from `contracts_map`, carrying at minimum: `repair_class`, `finding_id`, `scope`, `before`, `after`, `permitted_reason`, `performed_at`, `run_id`, and the **compensating action** the change plan was required to name and test (§53.7, §28.1) — without that field, §53.7's revert branch has nothing to revert against.

Records are handed to the control-plane write path; this lane does not write them into `records/**` (Lane 4, AT-110 attempt 5).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Every repair produces exactly one record, with `before` and `after` both populated.
2. A record missing `compensating_action` raises at emit time.
3. No write reaches `records/**` or `events/**` from this module.

### L3-P6-09 — Prohibited-repair guards

**Phase** 6 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P6-01 · **Spec** §53.3 (*"never modifies production runtime configuration, never modifies data, and never rotates or writes secrets"*); §40.1; AT-110

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/guards.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_repair_guards.py`

Implement an import-time guard asserting, for every module under `reconciler/repair/**`: it calls `permitted()` before any write; it contains no call that writes a secret, an environment, a workflow file, an organisation setting, or `records/**`. Run the guard as a test over the package, so adding a sixth repair class in future cannot skip it.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. The guard enumerates every module under `reconciler/repair/**` — it does not use a hard-coded module list.
2. A deliberately non-compliant test module fails the guard.
3. All five shipped classes pass.

### L3-P6-10 — Repeated failed repair escalates to Level 5

**Phase** 6 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P6-08 · **Spec** §53.2 Level 5 (*"repeated failed auto-repair"*, *"a repair class discovered to have written incorrect state"*)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/repair/escalation.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_repair_escalation.py`

Implement `evaluate(repair_history, threshold)` raising `Level.ESCALATE` when a repair class fails repeatedly against the same scope. The threshold is configuration with an initial value of 3 consecutive failures. Escalation creates an incident and notifies the escalation role — **emit the escalation object only**; routing belongs to Lane 5 (`notify/**`).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Three consecutive failures on one scope produce `Level.ESCALATE`.
2. Two failures do not.
3. No notification call exists in this lane.

## 10. Phase 7 — Lifecycle operations and registry-edit staging

§98.3 places `change-role`, `remove-person` and template evolution in early hardening: *"Scaffolding v0 (`create-product`, `add-person`) ships in Phase 3 … the rest follow the first role change and the first departure."*

---

### L3-P7-01 — `change-role` operation

**Phase** 7 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P4-09 · **Spec** §12.6 (`change role`); §12.3; §101 invariant 56; AT-005

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/change_role.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_change_role.py`

Compose the plan in **exactly** the §12.6 order, seven steps: `role_update`, `capability_recalculation`, `permission_recalculation`, `reviewer_matrix_reassessment`, `ownership_reassessment_prompt`, `incident_responder_reassessment`, `dashboard_update`. Every step is **declarative**: the operation edits registry state and lets reconciliation apply it (§101 invariant 55: *"Ownership changes are declarative and take effect through reconciliation"*).

Two hard rules, both from §74 and §101 invariants 36–38: `ownership_reassessment_prompt` is a **prompt**, never an automatic reassignment; and this operation must contain **no code path** to a formal people decision — promotion, compensation, warning, improvement plan or exit (AT-071: *"No code path exists to an automated improvement plan, termination, promotion, compensation change or formal warning"*).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `PLAN change-role steps=7 writes=0 manual=0` on a dry run.
2. `ownership_reassessment_prompt` emits a prompt, and a test asserts no automatic reassignment occurs.
3. `grep -riE "promotion|termination|compensation|improvement_plan|formal_warning" tools/provision/change_role.py` returns nothing outside a refusal guard.

### L3-P7-02 — `remove-person` operation

**Phase** 7 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P2-05, L3-P4-09 · **Spec** §12.2 (the RECONCILIATION EXECUTES block); §12.6 (`remove person`); §101 invariant 57; AT-017

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/remove_person.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_remove_person.py`

Compose the plan in **exactly** the §12.2 order, eleven steps:

| # | Step id | §12.2 line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `remove_from_organisation` | remove from organisation |
| 2 | `remove_from_every_team` | remove from every GitHub Team |
| 3 | `revoke_every_environment_access` | revoke every environment access |
| 4 | `revoke_production_capability` | revoke production capability |
| 5 | `deactivate_ai_runtime` | deactivate AI runtime |
| 6 | `stop_self_view_and_retire_key` | stop self-view generation and retire the registered self-view key material (§90.6) |
| 7 | `remove_from_reviewer_matrix` | remove from reviewer matrix |
| 8 | `recalculate_ownership` | recalculate ownership |
| 9 | `recalculate_incident_responders` | recalculate incident responder assignments |
| 10 | `orphan_detection` | ORPHAN DETECTION RUNS |
| 11 | `exit_record` | EXIT RECORD COMPLETED |

Two further rules, both transcribed: the person record is **retained, never deleted, and the identifier is never reused** (§12.2 final line); and a departing succession designate in `topology.yaml` is **flagged immediately** so succession is never left vacant by a departure (§12.2).

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. `PLAN remove-person steps=11 writes=0 manual=0` on a dry run.
2. No step deletes a person record, and a test asserts the identifier is not released for reuse.
3. Step 10 invokes the Phase 2 orphan detector, and Blocking orphans returned by it cannot be dismissed (L3-P2-06, invariant 57).

### L3-P7-03 — Registry-edit canary staging

**Phase** 7 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P6-02 · **Spec** §26.4 *"Registry edits stage before they reach the fleet"* (both rules); §61.5

**Files (create):** `reconciler/staging.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_staging.py`

Rule one, transcribed: *"a merged registry change is applied by the next reconciliation run to the declared canary set only; the remainder of the fleet is held for one reconciliation cycle and applied only after the canary cycle records a clean run."*

Implement `stage(change, canary_set, last_canary_run)` returning the set of products a run may apply the change to. The fleet is released **only** when the immediately preceding canary cycle recorded a clean run — and a canary cycle whose run was `FAILED`, including a canary-missing run (L3-P1-17), is **not** clean.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. The first run after a merged registry change applies to the canary set only.
2. The fleet is released only after a clean canary cycle; a `FAILED` canary cycle holds the fleet.
3. Staging binds in bootstrap mode too (§26.4: *"Both rules remain binding in bootstrap"*) — a test asserts the bootstrap flag does not bypass it.

### L3-P7-04 — Authority-delta detector

**Phase** 7 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P7-03 · **Spec** §26.4 rule two (*"an authority delta — a diff that adds a capability, adds an assignment type conferring Write, or changes `access_status` — fails CI without a linked decision record ID in the same commit"*)

**Files (create):** `validators/drift/authority_delta.py`, `validators/drift/tests/test_authority_delta.py`

Implement `detect(diff) -> list[AuthorityDelta]` recognising exactly the three deltas §26.4 names: a capability added; an assignment type conferring Write added (`primary_owner`, `cross_reviewer`, `backup_owner`, `temporary_contributor` — §11.2); `access_status` changed. Each delta without a linked decision-record ID in the same commit fails.

§26.4 gives the reason, and it belongs in the module docstring: *"where a wrong revocation is caught by orphan risk (SIG-05), a wrong grant has no detector at all."*

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All three delta kinds are detected; a diff touching only a display name is not a delta.
2. A delta with a decision-record ID in the same commit passes; without one it fails.
3. The detector lives in `validators/drift/**` and imports nothing from `reconciler/**` (it guards the registry, not the instrument).

### L3-P7-05 — Temporary-person expiry treated as an exit

**Phase** 7 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P7-02 · **Spec** §12.2 (*"Temporary-person expiry is an exit. Expiry of a temporary specialist or contractor triggers the same exit record and orphan scan as `remove person`"*); §12.4; AT-008

**Files (create):** `tools/provision/temp_expiry.py`, `tools/provision/tests/test_temp_expiry.py`

Implement `on_expiry(person, as_of)` invoking the **same** eleven-step `remove-person` plan, not a reduced variant, and additionally raising orphan type 14 where the expiring person holds open gate-relevant work — §12.2 names it *"the fourteenth orphan type."*

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. An expiring temporary person produces the identical eleven-step plan as `remove-person`.
2. Orphan type 14 is raised when the person holds an open gate item at expiry.
3. Expiry requires no human action to execute (AT-008: *"reconciliation revokes on the end date without human action"*).

## 11. Phase 8 — The control-loop gap procedure and lane closure

§53.7: *"The control loop can fail in two directions. It can go dark … It can also run and repair against a wrongly-computed declared state, which completes, records clean, and is therefore invisible to every check that asks only whether the loop ran."* This phase builds both branches.

### L3-P8-01 — Gap detector and expiry replay

**Phase** 8 · **Size** M · **Deps** L3-P6-06 · **Spec** §53.7 bullets 1 and 3; §46.1

**Files (create):** `reconciler/gap/__init__.py`, `reconciler/gap/detect.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_gap_detect.py`

Implement `detect_gap(run_history, expected_interval, as_of)` returning the gap window when a reconciliation, export or health-report cycle was missed, and `replay_expiries(window)` — §53.7 bullet 1: *"Replay expiries that should have fired during the gap — assignment `end_date`s, temporary access, exception expiries — and revoke or revert anything now overdue."* Then re-run all standing checks and confirm clean results, **including the seeded canary** (bullet 3).

Recording the gap as a Level 5 incident (bullet 4) is emitted here and routed by Lane 5.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. A missed cycle produces a gap window with explicit start and end.
2. Every expiry falling inside the window is replayed; none is skipped as "already past".
3. The re-run confirmation fails if the canary is missing (L3-P1-17).

**Files (create):** `reconciler/gap/audit.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_gap_audit.py`

Implement `diff_audit(window, declared, actual)` enumerating every access grant, merge and production approval inside the window and comparing each against declared state. The default posture is **unverified**, not clean: an item the audit cannot evidence is reported as unverified, never as passing.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All three classes — access grants, merges, production approvals — are audited.
2. An item with no evidence is reported `unverified`, and a test asserts it is never reported `clean`.
3. The audit produces a list, not a boolean: a gap window that "looks fine" still enumerates what it checked.

**Files (create):** `reconciler/gap/marking.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_gap_marking.py`

Implement `mark(records, window)` setting `gap_window=True` on every record produced inside the window, `clear(record, verifier, at)` clearing it only on explicit re-verification, and `is_gate_evidence(record)` returning `False` while the mark stands.

**Acceptance** — all true:

### L3-P8-04 — Wrong-repair freeze and revert branch

**Phase** 8 · **Size** L · **Deps** L3-P6-08 · **Spec** §53.7 *"When the loop ran wrong"* (verbatim); §53.2 Level 5; §28.1

**Files (create):** `reconciler/gap/wrong_repair.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_wrong_repair.py`

§53.7, transcribed: *"A repair class discovered to have written incorrect state is a Level 5 escalation in its own right … freeze that repair class, enumerate its repairs in the affected window from the repair records of Section 26.4, revert or human-confirm each against the compensating action its change plan was required to name and test (Section 28.1), and mark every record produced in the window `gap-window` until re-verified."*

Implement `on_wrong_repair(repair_class, window)` performing exactly those four actions in that order: **freeze** (set `enabled=False` in the enablement registry and refuse re-enable without a decision record), **enumerate** from the L3-P6-08 repair records, **revert or human-confirm** each against its recorded `compensating_action`, **mark** the window per L3-P8-03.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. Freezing sets the class disabled and blocks re-enable without a decision record.
2. Enumeration reads the repair records, not the live state — the live state is what is suspect.
3. A repair record lacking `compensating_action` halts the revert and escalates, rather than guessing a reversal.

### L3-P8-05 — Lane acceptance-matrix runner

**Phase** 8 · **Size** M · **Deps** every task above · **Spec** §100 (the eleven acceptance tests this lane owns)

**Files (create):** `reconciler/acceptance/__init__.py`, `reconciler/acceptance/run_matrix.py`, `reconciler/tests/test_acceptance_matrix.py`

Implement a runner executing, against `fixture-a`, exactly the eleven Section 100 tests Lane 3 is responsible for, each mapped to the task that implements it:

| AT | Test (§100) | Implemented by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AT-002 | Add a person — *"Reconciliation grants access … No workflow, architecture or dashboard change"* | L3-P4-09 |
| AT-008 | Temporary specialist joins — *"reconciliation revokes on the end date without human action"* | L3-P1-09, L3-P6-06, L3-P7-05 |
| AT-017 | A person leaves — *"Reconciliation revokes access; orphan detection surfaces every unowned responsibility; blocking orphans cannot be dismissed unresolved"* | L3-P7-02, L3-P2-06 |
| AT-018 | A temporary assignment expires — *"Reconciliation removes it without human action"* | L3-P6-06 |
| AT-032 | Self-observability — *"detects and reports a failure in its own reconciliation"* | L3-P1-20, L3-P5-05 |
| AT-033 | No auto-loosening — *"raises it for human review and does not relax it"* | L3-P6-01, L3-P6-05 |
| AT-036 | A temporary access exception expires — *"with no human action"* | L3-P6-06 |
| AT-037 | A failed exception is visible — *"becomes Blocking drift on its expiry date"* | L3-P6-06 |
| AT-102 | The seeded reconciliation canary — *"A run reporting zero findings … is a failed run"* | L3-P1-17 |
| AT-110 | The reconciler credential is provably bounded — six attempts | L3-P5-06 |
| AT-001 | Add product 21 — *"No dashboard, workflow or script contains a product list"* | L3-P4-07 |

Output: one line per test, `AT <id> result=<pass|fail>`, then `MATRIX passed=<int> total=11`.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All eleven run and pass against `fixture-a`.
2. Each row names the task implementing it; an unmapped AT id fails the runner.
3. The runner touches no live GitHub organisation.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/contracts/project-config.sh"
check_org

git fetch origin
git checkout integration
git checkout -b lane/3/p8-05-acceptance-matrix

# Create reconciler/acceptance/__init__.py, acceptance/run_matrix.py, tests/test_acceptance_matrix.py

git add reconciler/acceptance/__init__.py reconciler/acceptance/run_matrix.py reconciler/tests/test_acceptance_matrix.py
bash lane-guard.sh && echo "LG OK"
git commit -m "L3-P8-05: lane acceptance-matrix runner"
git push -u origin lane/3/p8-05-acceptance-matrix
gh pr create --title "L3-P8-05: lane acceptance-matrix runner" --base integration --body "Closes L3-P8-05"
```

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python -m reconciler.acceptance.run_matrix --summary | tail -1
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
MATRIX passed=11 total=11
```

**STOP** — if any AT fails, do **not** adjust the test to match the code. Find the task that owns that AT in the table above, reopen it, and file the blocker naming both the AT and the task id.

### L3-P8-06 — Lane handoff manifest

**Phase** 8 · **Size** S · **Deps** L3-P8-05 · **Spec** §0.4 above; `PARTITION.md` rules 2 and 4

**Files (create):** `reconciler/HANDOFF.md`, `reconciler/scripts/check-handoff.sh`

Write `reconciler/HANDOFF.md` stating, for each of the three consumers, what Lane 3 hands over and what it does **not** build:

| Consumer | Lane 3 hands over | Lane 3 does not build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L5** (`ops-vm/**`) | `python -m reconciler.cli run --live` as the scheduled entry point, its exit-code contract (§0.5), its expected source host and run-count ceiling (L3-P5-07) | the systemd timer or any ops-VM configuration |
| **L2** (`.github/workflows/**`) | `python -m validators.drift.verifier --live` as the scheduled entry point, and the requirement that it run under `DRIFT_VERIFIER_TOKEN`, a credential distinct from the reconciler's (§53.1) | the workflow YAML, or the surface it writes its result to |
| **L4** (`records/**`, `schemas/records/**`) | run records, drift findings and repair records as contract-shaped objects, handed over for writing | any write to `records/**` or `events/**` — AT-110 attempt 5 forbids it |

`check-handoff.sh` asserts the file exists, names all three consumers, and that no Lane 3 module writes to `records/`, `events/`, `.github/workflows/` or `ops-vm/`.

**Acceptance** — all true:
1. All three consumers are named with their entry point and their boundary.
2. The script finds zero writes from Lane 3 code into any foreign path.
3. `reconciler/scripts/check-ownership.sh` still passes on the final branch.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/contracts/project-config.sh"
check_org

git fetch origin
git checkout integration
git checkout -b lane/3/p8-06-handoff

# Create reconciler/HANDOFF.md, scripts/check-handoff.sh

git add reconciler/HANDOFF.md reconciler/scripts/check-handoff.sh
bash lane-guard.sh && echo "LG OK"
git commit -m "L3-P8-06: lane handoff manifest"
git push -u origin lane/3/p8-06-handoff
gh pr create --title "L3-P8-06: lane handoff manifest" --base integration --body "Closes L3-P8-06"
```

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
bash reconciler/scripts/check-handoff.sh && bash reconciler/scripts/check-ownership.sh
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
HANDOFF OK consumers=3 foreign-writes=0
OWNERSHIP OK
```

**STOP** — if any consumer's entry point does not yet exist, stop: it means a task above is unmerged. Do not write a placeholder. File the blocker naming the missing task id.

## 12. Pending mutation script deliverables

The tasks in this section create the mutation scripts listed as `MUTATION-NEEDED` in `protocol/03-invariant-tests.md` §8.5 and §9.3. Each script mutates the fixture so the named negative test flips from PASS to FAIL, proving the test is not vacuous. Safety rule SR-2 (§1): mutations happen only in disposable fixture repositories — never in a live reconciler tree.

### L3-IT537-N1 — Create IT-537-N1.mutation.sh

**Size:** S  **Depends on:** L3-P6 repair-class tasks  **Branch slug:** `lane/3/it537-n1-mutation`

**Creates:** `reconciler/invariant-tests/mutations/IT-537-N1.mutation.sh`

**Spec:** `protocol/03-invariant-tests.md` §8.5 (`# MUTATION-NEEDED: create IT-537-N1.mutation.sh`). The mutation suppresses the freeze signal emitted by a repair class when it detects it has written incorrect state. The class continues running rather than halting and raising a Level 5 escalation. Under the mutation IT-537-N1 must flip from PASS to FAIL.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT:?STOP: CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT is not exported}"
cd "$CONTROL_PLANE_ROOT"
git fetch origin && git checkout integration && git pull --ff-only origin integration
git checkout -b lane/3/it537-n1-mutation

```

Expected output, exactly: `IT-537-N1.mutation.sh present and executable`

**STOP rule:** If applying the mutation does not cause IT-537-N1 to exit non-zero, the test is vacuous. File a blocker titled `VACUOUS-TEST IT-537-N1` and stop the lane immediately.

### L3-IT537-N3 — Create IT-537-N3.mutation.sh

**Size:** S  **Depends on:** L3-P6 repair-class tasks  **Branch slug:** `lane/3/it537-n3-mutation`

**Creates:** `reconciler/invariant-tests/mutations/IT-537-N3.mutation.sh`

**Spec:** `protocol/03-invariant-tests.md` §8.5 (`# MUTATION-NEEDED: create IT-537-N3.mutation.sh`). The mutation makes the gap-close procedure skip re-running expiries whose `end_date` fell inside the gap window, so an expired assignment remains provisioned. Under the mutation IT-537-N3 must flip from PASS to FAIL.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail

### L3-IT111-R-N2 — Create IT-111-R-N2.mutation.sh

**Size:** S  **Depends on:** none within this lane (IT-111-R invariant test owned by L4; mutation script is an L3 lane deliverable per `protocol/03-invariant-tests.md` §9.3)  **Branch slug:** `lane/3/it111-r-n2-mutation`

**Creates:** `reconciler/invariant-tests/mutations/IT-111-R-N2.mutation.sh`

**Spec:** `protocol/03-invariant-tests.md` §9.3 (`# MUTATION-NEEDED: create IT-111-R-N2.mutation.sh`). The mutation allows a free-text `reproduction_notes` field in the fixture records schema so an incident record carrying a non-synthetic reproduction fixture passes schema validation. Under the mutation IT-111-R-N2 must flip from PASS to FAIL.

**Commands**

## 13. Closing notes for the executor

1. **Order is not advisory.** Phase 6 exists after Phase 5 because §99.6 risk 6 requires detect-only first and repair classes enabled one at a time. Reordering to "get repairs working sooner" is the exact failure mode the risk names.
2. **Every number in this file is derived from `fixture-a` (L3-P0-04).** If a SELF-VERIFY number is wrong, the fixture changed. Restore the fixture; do not edit the expectation.
3. **Five decisions belong to L0**, not to you: L3-D1 (runtime), L3-D2 (contract paths), L3-D3 (credential form), L3-D4 (orphan severity mapping), and every reclassification under §53.5. If a task seems to require a sixth, that is a STOP.
4. **You never write outside `reconciler/**`, `tools/provision/**`, `validators/drift/**`.** Not once, not for a one-line fix, not for a test fixture.
5. **The reconciler is the highest-privilege identity in the system** (§99.6 risk 6). When a shortcut and a safety rule disagree in this lane, the safety rule wins and the shortcut becomes a blocker issue.
