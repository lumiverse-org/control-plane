# L4 — PHASE 3 — HOW RECORDS GET WRITTEN

**Lane:** L4 Records, Events & Metrics (subsystems I, N)
**Phase:** 3 — write paths
**Phase branch:** `lane/4/03-write-paths` (one branch for the phase, one commit per task, one PR at the end — the convention the lane charter established for `lane/4/00-charter-preflight`)
**Authority:** `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Code/implementation/PARTITION.md` is FROZEN and wins over this file. `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Code/implementation/lanes/L4-00-charter.md` is the lane charter; its §3 owned-path list, §9 decisions and §12 standing rules bind every task here.
**Spec of record:** `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` (10,214 lines). Every line number below was located with `grep`/`sed` and is cited, not inferred.

> [!NOTE]
> **Implementation architecture superseded per FD-131 (2026-10-22):** The shell-script design in this document (`lib/emit.sh` and shell script bodies) is superseded by Python stdlib modules (`tools/records/lib/writer.py`, `nooverwrite.py`, `eventpath.py`, `rwtoken.py`, `tools/records/record_write.py`, `event_append.py`, `rvr.py`) with dedicated pytest suites under `tools/records/tests/`. CLI frontends (`record-write`, `event-append`, `record-verification-result`) delegate to these Python modules.

---

## 1. The one rule this phase implements

Master Spec §97.2, line 8871:

> **RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT** is the single pattern by which a human manual result reaches the machine: a `workflow_dispatch` with structured inputs — product, item, mechanism, pass or fail, evidence link — that writes the corresponding record and appends the event. Manual UAT and verification results (Section 31), restore-test confirmations (Section 44) and support-loop closures (Section 22) all reach their stores through this dispatch; **nobody edits a record file by hand to report a result.**

Phase 1 built the stores. Phase 2 built the shapes. **Phase 3 builds the doors.** After Phase 3 there is exactly one door per store, it is named in a machine-readable register, and a guard fails any pull request that walks past it.

Three further spec facts make this phase load-bearing:

| Fact | Spec anchor |
|---|---|
| Records are *generated from* the workflow surface; nobody transcribes | §97.1, line 8838 |
| The deployment-record and event writes are **required, failing steps** of `deploy-production.yml`, not trailing best-effort ones | §97.2, line 8867 |
| A record is never edited in place; corrections are follow-up records. Historical records are never silently overwritten (invariant 48) | §97.2, line 8890; §101.7, line 9516 |

---

## 2. Fixed workspace convention (binding for every task in this file)

```bash
export CP_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
export CPR_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane-records"
export SPEC="C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md"
```

Re-export these at the start of **every** task. The Bash tool resets the working directory between calls; always use absolute paths.

**Paths this phase writes — nothing else:**

| Repository | Path |
|---|---|
| `control-plane` | `tools/records/**` |
| `control-plane-records` | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |

`schemas/records/**` and `metrics/**` are L4-owned but are **not** written by Phase 3. `.github/workflows/**` in `control-plane` is L2's (PARTITION.md line 18) — Phase 3 publishes the *handler* and the *input contract*; L2 writes the workflow file that calls it. `control-plane-records/.github/` is untouched until charter decision **D-L4-03** resolves.

---

## 3. THE WRITE-PATH TABLE — normative

Every canonical record store of §97.2 (lines 8845–8866), the actor that writes it, and the path by which that actor writes it. This table is the human-readable face of `tools/records/write-paths.yaml`, built in task **L4-T302**. Where the two differ, the YAML file is authoritative and the difference is a blocker for L0.

| # | Store | Writer actor (spec wording) | Write path class | Second path | Hand-authored? | Spec line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `records/incidents/` | Incident workflow, from the incident issue template | `machine-workflow` | — | No | 8847 |
| 2 | `records/postmortems/` | Human, from template; closure tracked | `human-review-lane` | — | **Yes** | 8848 |
| 3 | `records/uat/` | CI job on UAT completion, from `verification/uat.md` execution | `machine-workflow` | `rvr-dispatch` (manual UAT, §31.2 line 2790) | No | 8849 |
| 4 | `records/estimates/` | Board automation at item close | `machine-board` | — | No | 8850 |
| 5 | `records/deployments/` | Deploy workflow | `machine-deploy` | — | No | 8851 |
| 6 | `records/restore-tests/` | The restore-test workflow, plus the human integrity confirmation through the RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT dispatch | `machine-workflow` | `rvr-dispatch` (§44.3 line 4008) | No | 8851 |
| 7 | `records/decisions/` | Human, at the moment of decision | `cli-record-decision` | `human-review-lane` | **Yes** | 8852 |
| 8 | `records/decisions/pending/` | The record-decision CLI when a decision prompt is opened | `cli-record-decision` | — | No | 8853 |
| 9 | `records/breaches/` | Security-incident workflow, when an incident is classified as a breach | `machine-workflow` | — | No | 8854 |
| 10 | `records/deletion-requests/` | Deletion runbook via the RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT dispatch | `rvr-dispatch` | — | No | 8855 |
| 11 | `records/security-reviews/` | Security reviewer, from template | `human-review-lane` | — | **Yes** | 8856 |
| 12 | `records/eval/` | The scheduled eval runner and pin-change CI | `machine-workflow` | — | No | 8857 |
| 13 | `records/launches/` | The launch-pack generator at launch-readiness sign-off | `machine-workflow` | — | No | 8858 |
| 14 | `records/demos/` | Human, brief, after each client demo or UAT walkthrough | `human-review-lane` | — | **Yes** | 8859 |
| 15 | `records/support/` | Support intake workflow | `machine-workflow` | `rvr-dispatch` (loop closure, §22.5 line 2256); `machine-workflow` again for the one-tap Founder log entry, §22.8 line 2286 | No | 8860 |
| 16 | `records/onboarding/` | Onboarding workflow at phase completion; human for judgment steps | `machine-workflow` | `human-review-lane` (judgment steps only) | **Yes**, judgment steps only | 8861 |
| 17 | `records/leave/` | Founder or delegate on approval | `human-review-lane` | — | **Yes** | 8862 |
| 18 | `events/` | Every workflow | `machine-workflow` | — | No | 8866 |

`exceptions.yaml`, `policies.yaml` and `patterns.yaml` also appear in the §97.2 table (lines 8863–8865). They live in the **control-plane** repository under `registries/**`, which PARTITION.md line 17 gives to **L1**. They are out of scope for this phase and appear in no L4 file.

### 3.1 The six write-path classes — closed set

| Class | Actor identity | Credential | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| `machine-workflow` | A control-plane or product GitHub Actions workflow | records-writer GitHub App installation token (§40.1, line 3667) | Calls `tools/records/lib/emit.sh` through a Phase-3 emitter or through the RVR handler |
| `machine-board` | Board automation on the designated work-management system | records-writer | Calls `tools/records/board-emit` or `tools/records/rqm-emit` |
| `machine-deploy` | `deploy-production.yml` / `deploy-staging.yml` | records-writer | Calls `tools/records/deploy-emit` as a **required, failing step** (§97.2, line 8867) |
| `rvr-dispatch` | A human, through `workflow_dispatch` with structured inputs | records-writer (the workflow's, not the human's) | Calls `tools/records/record-verification-result` |
| `cli-record-decision` | The record-decision CLI (§99.2 tool table, line 9217 — subsystems A, O; **not an L4 tool**) | records-writer | Calls `tools/records/record-write` / `event-append`, which delegate to `emit.sh` |
| `human-review-lane` | A named person | The person's own GitHub identity | A pull request on `control-plane-records`, subject to `tools/records/validate-human-record.sh` |

**Result-reporting stores.** Every store whose `hand_authored` flag is `No` is a **result-reporting store**: a hand-authored file appearing there in a pull request is rejected by the guard built in **L4-T314**. This is line 8871's last clause made mechanical.

---

## 4. Phase entry conditions

Task **L4-T301** proves every row. If any row fails, no other task in this phase starts.

| # | Condition | Why | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | `control-plane` and `control-plane-records` are git repositories with the Phase 1 skeleton (19 `.gitkeep` store markers) | Charter L4-T002 | `git -C "$CPR_ROOT" ls-files \| grep -c '/\.gitkeep$'` = `19` |
| E2 | `$CP_ROOT/contracts/registry/event-types.v1.yaml` exists | §97.3, line 8959 — no workflow ever writes an untyped event | `test -f` |
| E3 | `$CP_ROOT/schemas/records/` exists and holds at least `event.envelope.schema.json` | Charter DoD-2, DoD-3 | `test -f` |
| E4 | `python3` is on PATH and can `import yaml` | Every L4 validator reads YAML records | exit 0 |
| E5 | `$CP_ROOT/tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh` exists and is executable | Charter L4-T005 | `test -x` |

If E2 or E3 fail, the phase that owns them has not merged. **Do not create them here.** Open the blocker in L4-T301.

---

## 5. DECISION REQUIRED — hand to L0

Three questions. **No L4 executor may answer them.** Each blocks only the task named; everything else in the phase proceeds. Charter decisions **D-L4-01**, **D-L4-02** and **D-L4-03** remain open and are not restated here.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P3-01 — the §18.4 sunset-runbook RVR rows name no target store

- **Fact:** §18.4, line 1798, routes manual sunset-runbook items through RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT. Rows 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 (lines 1804, 1806, 1809, 1810, 1811) each say "RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT with … evidence" and name **no record store**. Row 6 (line 1807) is the only one that names one (`records/deletion-requests/`). `grep -n "records/" MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` over lines 1796–1822 returns exactly one store path.
- **Question:** Which store do sunset-runbook RVR results land in — an existing §97.2 store, or a new store requiring a §97.2 table amendment?
- **Blocks:** the sunset mechanisms only. The four armed mechanisms of L4-T304 are unaffected.
- **L4 default until answered:** `tools/records/dispatch/rvr-inputs.yaml` declares exactly four mechanisms. It declares **no** sunset mechanism and **no** placeholder store.
- **L4 must not:** invent a store directory, and must not route a sunset result into an existing store by resemblance.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P3-02 — "branch protection" on a repository that has none

- **Fact:** §97.1, line 8841: *"Human edits to records travel the normal review lane, as pull requests **under branch protection** like any other change."* §40.1, line 3667 (D89): the Records repository has *"**No protection rules** — the store is append-only by convention and by the write path, not by review."* PARTITION.md line 8 restates D107: no review protection; a no-bypass ruleset blocking force-push and deletion only.
- **Question:** For the `human-review-lane` stores (postmortems, decisions, security-reviews, demos, leave, onboarding judgment steps), what enforces the review that line 8841 requires, given that line 3667 forbids the branch protection line 8841 names? Options as stated in the spec, not invented: (a) a required status check that is not review protection; (b) review protection on `control-plane-records` overriding D107; (c) convention only, with `validate-human-record.sh` as the sole mechanical control.
- **Blocks:** the enforcement half of L4-T313 and L4-T314 only.
- **L4 default until answered:** `validate-human-record.sh` is built and is runnable as a status check. **L4 requests no branch protection and no ruleset change on `control-plane-records`** (charter §3 forbids it), and `CONTRIBUTING.md` records the open question verbatim for L0.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P3-03 — three write paths have no `event_type` identifier in the §97.3 taxonomy

> **Provenance note (D114-D / REG-021, 2026-09-02):** the decisions register (`lanes/L0-04-decisions-register.md` line 2290) now shows **REG-021 closed**, and all three identifiers — `support_loop_closure`, `deletion_request_recorded`, `work_item_closed` — exist in the corrected 89-identifier enum (`run-phase-0.sh` L0-P0-011; `tests/integration/test_event_type_enum.py`). This section, the `L4-T304` mechanism table below (the `support_loop_closure` and `deletion_provider_confirmation` rows, still `event_type: unarmed` / `armed: false`), and `L4-T307`'s `test-rvr.sh` negative fixture (`unarmed-mechanism ... support_loop_closure ... exit 3`) have **not** been re-armed for that closure. Doing so requires deciding the exact event_type mapping for each mechanism — `deletion_provider_confirmation` is not textually named `deletion_request_recorded` anywhere in this file, so that mapping needs stating, not assuming — and reworking the test harness's case count and record/event-count assertions accordingly. That is a design decision for whoever arms these mechanisms, not a mechanical edit, and has deliberately been left undone here.

- **Fact:** §97.3, line 8959: *"A new event type is a governed addition to the enum and to this taxonomy."* The tracked-events list (line 8963) contains `support item ingested` and `support first-touch breach` but **no** support-loop-closure entry; contains no deletion-request entry at all; and contains no work-item-closed entry, although §97.2 line 8850 writes `records/estimates/` "at item close". Verified by `sed -n '8963p' MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md | grep -c "loop clos\|deletion\|item closed"` → `0`. **CAUTION:** `sed -n '8951p'` was the pre-D113 command; after D113 renumbering use `sed -n '8963p'` instead.
- **Question:** L0 to obtain the governed addition of the three identifiers, or to name the existing identifiers these three writes must reuse.
- **Blocks:** the `support_loop_closure` and `deletion_provider_confirmation` mechanisms of L4-T305, and the estimate-at-close emission of L4-T308.
- **L4 default until answered:** those rows carry `event_type: unarmed` in their contract file. The emitter **fails closed** with `EMIT FAIL unknown-event-type` rather than writing an untyped event (§97.3, line 8947). A record without its event is never written: `emit_pair` rolls the record back.
- **L4 must not:** invent an identifier, write to `registries/platform.yaml`, or fall back to free text.

## 6. Tasks

Sixteen tasks, L4-T301 through L4-T316. Each is mechanical. None requires designing, choosing or interpreting.

---

### L4-T301 — Phase-3 preflight and phase branch

**Size:** S
**Depends on:** none (phase entry)

**Commands**

```bash
export CP_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
export CPR_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane-records"
git -C "$CP_ROOT" fetch --all --prune
git -C "$CP_ROOT" checkout -B lane/4/03-write-paths origin/integration
git -C "$CP_ROOT" status --porcelain
git -C "$CPR_ROOT" fetch --all --prune
git -C "$CPR_ROOT" checkout -B lane/4/03-write-paths origin/main
echo "E1=$(git -C "$CPR_ROOT" ls-files | grep -c '/\.gitkeep$')"
test -f "$CP_ROOT/contracts/registry/event-types.v1.yaml" && echo "E2=yes" || echo "E2=no"
test -f "$CP_ROOT/schemas/records/event.envelope.schema.json" && echo "E3=yes" || echo "E3=no"
python3 -c "import yaml; print('E4=yes')" 2>/dev/null || echo "E4=no"
test -x "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh" && echo "E5=yes" || echo "E5=no"
mkdir -p "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/lib" "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/dispatch" "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/fixtures"
```

**Acceptance criteria**

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Phase branch created off `origin/integration` | `git -C "$CP_ROOT" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` | `lane/4/03-write-paths` |
| 2 | Working tree clean before any write | `git -C "$CP_ROOT" status --porcelain \| wc -l` | `0` |
| 3 | Phase 1 store skeleton present | `git -C "$CPR_ROOT" ls-files \| grep -c '/\.gitkeep$'` | `19` |
| 4 | Event taxonomy present (E2) | `test -f "$CP_ROOT/contracts/registry/event-types.v1.yaml" && echo YES` | `YES` |
| 5 | Event envelope schema present (E3) | `test -f "$CP_ROOT/schemas/records/event.envelope.schema.json" && echo YES` | `YES` |
| 6 | `python3` + PyYAML usable (E4) | `python3 -c "import yaml"; echo $?` | `0` |
| 7 | Three working directories created | `ls -d "$CP_ROOT"/tools/records/{lib,dispatch,fixtures} \| wc -l` | `3` |

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
export CP_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
export CPR_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane-records"
echo "BRANCH=$(git -C "$CP_ROOT" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
echo "CPRBRANCH=$(git -C "$CPR_ROOT" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
echo "DIRTY=$(git -C "$CP_ROOT" status --porcelain | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "STORES=$(git -C "$CPR_ROOT" ls-files | grep -c '/\.gitkeep$')"
echo "TAXONOMY=$(test -f "$CP_ROOT/contracts/registry/event-types.v1.yaml" && echo yes || echo no)"
echo "ENVELOPE=$(test -f "$CP_ROOT/schemas/records/event.envelope.schema.json" && echo yes || echo no)"
echo "PYYAML=$(python3 -c 'import yaml' 2>/dev/null && echo yes || echo no)"
echo "DIRS=$(ls -d "$CP_ROOT"/tools/records/lib "$CP_ROOT"/tools/records/dispatch "$CP_ROOT"/tools/records/fixtures 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
BRANCH=lane/4/03-write-paths
CPRBRANCH=lane/4/03-write-paths
DIRTY=0
STORES=19
TAXONOMY=yes
ENVELOPE=yes
PYYAML=yes
DIRS=3
```

**STOP rule** — if any value differs from the expected block above: **do not create the missing artifact yourself.** `TAXONOMY=no` and `ENVELOPE=no` mean an earlier L4 phase has not merged to `integration`; creating them here duplicates another phase's authorship and will conflict at merge. `PYYAML=no` is a runner-image matter for L0. Open a blocker issue:

```yaml
title: "[L4-BLOCKER] L4-T301 Phase 3 entry condition failed"
lane: L4
phase: 3
task_id: L4-T301
blocked_by: "<taxonomy absent | envelope schema absent | store skeleton incomplete | pyyaml absent | tree dirty>"
observed: "<paste the exact SELF-VERIFY output>"
expected: "BRANCH=lane/4/03-write-paths / DIRTY=0 / STORES=19 / TAXONOMY=yes / ENVELOPE=yes / PYYAML=yes / DIRS=3"
spec_ref: "Master Spec v4.0 Section 97.3 line 8947; Section 97.2 lines 8843-8926; L4-00-charter.md section 7 DoD-1, DoD-3"
needs: "L0"
action_taken: "nothing created, nothing pushed"
```

### L4-T304 — The RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT input contract

**Depends on:** L4-T302
**Partially blocked by:** D-L4-P3-01 (sunset mechanisms) and D-L4-P3-03 (two `event_type` identifiers). Write the file below exactly as given; both defaults are already encoded in it.

This file is the contract **L2 transcribes into the `workflow_dispatch` `inputs:` block** of the workflow it owns. Phase 3 declares the inputs; L2 declares the workflow. The five inputs are §97.2 line 8871 verbatim: product, item, mechanism, pass or fail, evidence link.

```

**STOP rule** — if `ARMED` is not `2`: someone has armed a mechanism whose `event_type` does not exist in the §97.3 taxonomy. **Revert it.** §97.3 line 8947 requires a governed addition to the enum before an identifier may be emitted; arming it here writes an untyped event, which control-plane CI rejects.

### L4-T305 — The emission library `tools/records/lib/emit.sh`

> [!NOTE]
> **Implementation superseded per FD-131 (2026-10-22):** The shell-script design (`emit.sh`, bash wrappers) is superseded by Python stdlib modules (`writer.py`, `nooverwrite.py`, `eventpath.py`, `record_write.py`, `event_append.py`) and pytest suites in `tools/records/tests/`. Frontends delegate to these Python modules.

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T301

This is the **only** code in the estate that writes a record file or an event file. Every emitter in this phase calls it. It enforces four spec rules mechanically: UTC-with-offset timestamps (§97.1, line 8839), the record envelope (§97.2, line 8890), the closed `event_type` enum (§97.3, line 8947), and no silent overwrite (invariant 48, line 9516). It writes the record and its event as **one commit**, and rolls the record back if the event cannot be written — §97.2 line 8871's "writes the corresponding record **and** appends the event" is a pair, never a half.

The final block is **guarded**: if `record-write` / `event-append` already exist (delivered by another L4 phase), it verifies they delegate here and creates nothing. If they do not exist, it creates them as thin front-ends. Do not remove the guard.

`<path>` is the temporary file path and varies; every other token is exact.

**STOP rule** — if `DELEGATES` is not `2`, or the guard printed `RECORD-WRITE CONFLICT does-not-delegate`: a second implementation of the record write already exists in the tree. **Do not overwrite it and do not delete it** — two writers for one store is exactly the divergence §97.1 line 8838 forbids.

### L4-T306 — The RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT handler

**Acceptance criteria**

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Handler is executable | `test -x "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/record-verification-result" && echo YES` | `YES` |
| 2 | Handler takes exactly the six positional arguments (five inputs + actor) | `grep -c 'wrong-arity expected 6' "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/record-verification-result"` | `1` |
| 3 | Handler contains no hand-edit or in-place-edit path | `grep -cE '\bsed -i\b|>>' "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/record-verification-result"` | `0` |
| 4 | Handler resolves store, schema and event type from the contract, never from a literal | `grep -c 'rvr-inputs.yaml' "$CP_ROOT/tools/records/record-verification-result"` | `1` |
| 5 | Only `tools/records/` changed | `git -C "$CP_ROOT" diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD \| grep -vc '^tools/records/'` | `0` |

**SELF-VERIFY**

```

Expected output, exactly:

```
EXEC=yes
ARITY=1
INPLACE=0
CONTRACTDRIVEN=1
FOREIGN=0
```

**STOP rule** — if `INPLACE` is not `0`, the handler contains an append or in-place edit: §97.2 line 8890 forbids editing a record in place, and `emit_pair` is the only write. If `CONTRACTDRIVEN` is not `1`, the handler has a hard-coded store or event type, which drifts from `rvr-inputs.yaml` the moment D-L4-P3-03 resolves. Do not push. Open a blocker issue:

### L4-T308 — The board-event emission contract

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T302

Declares which board transition emits which `event_type`, and what the board automation writes. The identifiers are the lower-case underscore-separated forms of the §97.3 tracked-events list (line 8951), which line 8947 requires. **Phase 3 does not create identifiers** — `validate-board-events` (task L4-T310) proves each one exists in `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml`, and a miss is a blocker, never a taxonomy edit.

**Commands**

```bash

### L4-T309 — The board emitter and the Ready-queue-miss emitter

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T305, L4-T308

Two front-ends the board automation calls. `board-emit` emits a transition event (and, when the contract names a record, that record). `rqm-emit` emits the Ready-queue-miss event carrying the **full §29.4 field set**.

**Scope boundary, binding:** `rqm-emit` **emits**; it does not decide. It consumes a verdict document produced by the detector (charter DoD-8, another phase's task) and refuses to run without one. It never infers `team_lead_blocked` or `priority_changed_recently` — §97.5 line 8987: *"the last three supplied by the cause prompt, never inferred."*

### L4-T310 — Taxonomy conformance check for both emission contracts

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T304, L4-T308

Proves that every armed `event_type` in `rvr-inputs.yaml` and `board-events.yaml` already exists in `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml`. **This check never edits the taxonomy.** §97.3 line 8947: a new event type is a governed addition to the enum, and the enum lives in `registries/platform.yaml`, which L4 must never write (charter §3.1).

**STOP rule** — if any `absent-from-taxonomy` line appears, **do not add the identifier to `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml` and do not change the contract file to a name that happens to be present.** §97.3 line 8947 makes a new event type a governed addition; either the taxonomy is incomplete or the transliteration is wrong, and both are L0's call.

### L4-T311 — The deploy required-step contract

§97.2 line 8867 makes the deployment-record and event writes **required, failing steps** of `deploy-production.yml`. L2 owns that workflow file. Phase 3 publishes the contract L2 transcribes, and the emitter L2 calls. The contract states explicitly that no step may carry `continue-on-error: true`.

# required, failing steps of deploy-production.yml rather than trailing best-effort ones:

# and the eleven questions of Section 32 are unanswerable for it afterwards."

### L4-T313 — The deploy emitter failure test

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T312

Proves the required-failing-step property directly: when the records repository is unwritable, `deploy-emit` exits non-zero and leaves **nothing** behind. This is §97.2 line 8867 turned into a test rather than an assertion.

**Commands**

```bash

**Acceptance criteria**

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Test passes | `"$CP_ROOT/tools/records/test-deploy-emit.sh"` | `DEPLOY-EMIT OK 6/6`, exit 0 |
| 2 | The happy path produces exactly one record, one event, one commit | the three counts inside the test | no `DEPLOY CASE FAIL` line |
| 3 | An unwritable store makes the step exit non-zero | case 2 inside the test | no `unwritable-store-returned-zero` line |
| 4 | A failed event write leaves no orphan record (`emit_pair` rollback) | case 3 inside the test | no `orphan-record-after-event-failure` line |

Expected output, exactly:

```
RESULT=DEPLOY-EMIT OK 6/6
CPRCLEAN=0
CPRCOMMITS_STABLE=<the same number as before this task ran>
```

Record the commit count before running and compare; it must not change.

**STOP rule** — if `RESULT` is not `DEPLOY-EMIT OK 6/6`, fix `deploy-emit` or `lib/emit.sh`, never the test. In particular: if `orphan-record-after-event-failure` appears, `emit_pair`'s rollback is broken and a record can exist with no event, which is exactly the half-write §97.2 line 8871 forbids. If `CPRCLEAN` is not `0` or the commit count moved, the test escaped its sandbox. Open a blocker issue:

### L4-T314 — The human review lane, declared

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T302
**Partially blocked by:** D-L4-P3-02. The document below states the open question verbatim and requests no protection change; write it exactly as given.

**Commands**

```bash
export CPR_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane-records"
cat > "$CPR_ROOT/CONTRIBUTING.md" <<'CONTRIB_EOF'
# Contributing to control-plane-records

This repository holds `records/**` and `events/**` and nothing else.
Master Spec v4.0 Section 97 (lines 8834-8991) and Section 40.1 (lines 3644-3686) govern it.

## The one rule

**Nobody edits a record file by hand to report a result.** (Section 97.2, line 8871.)

A manual result reaches this repository through **RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT** — a
`workflow_dispatch` with five structured inputs (product, item, mechanism, pass or fail,
evidence link) that writes the record and appends the event in one commit. Manual UAT and
verification results (Section 31.2, line 2790), restore-test confirmations (Section 44.3,
line 4008) and support-loop closures (Section 22.5, line 2256) all arrive this way.

If you find yourself opening a text editor on a file under `records/` to say that something
passed, failed, completed or was confirmed: stop. Use the dispatch.

## Records are never edited in place

Section 97.2, line 8890: a record never edits in place; **corrections are follow-up records**.
Invariant 48 (line 9516): historical records are never silently overwritten.
A pull request that modifies or deletes an existing file under `records/` or `events/` is
rejected by `tools/records/validate-human-record.sh` in the control-plane repository.

## Which stores accept a hand-authored record

Six stores accept hand-authored records, and only these six. Every other store is written by
a machine path and a hand-authored file there is rejected.

| Store | Who authors | Spec line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `records/postmortems/` | Human, from template; closure tracked | 8848 |
| `records/decisions/` | Human, at the moment of decision (normally through the record-decision CLI) | 8852 |
| `records/security-reviews/` | Security reviewer, from template | 8856 |
| `records/demos/` | Human, brief, after each client demo or UAT walkthrough | 8859 |
| `records/onboarding/` | Onboarding workflow at phase completion; **human for judgment steps only** | 8861 |
| `records/leave/` | Founder or delegate on approval | 8862 |

Machine-written stores, for reference: incidents, uat, estimates, deployments, restore-tests,
decisions/pending, breaches, deletion-requests, eval, launches, support, and `events/`.
The full register with the writing actor and the write path for every store is
`tools/records/write-paths.yaml` in the control-plane repository.

## How to add a hand-authored record

1. Branch from the default branch.
2. Add **one new file** under the store's directory. Do not touch any existing file.
3. Every record carries `record_schema_version`, `id`, `product` and `timestamp`
   (Section 97.2, line 8890). Every timestamp is UTC **with its offset**
   (Section 97.1, line 8839) — for example `2026-08-27T09:31:04+00:00`.
4. Open a pull request. `validate-human-record.sh` runs against the diff.
5. A reviewer merges. Merges are fast-forward appends; the repository ruleset blocks
   force pushes, branch deletion and tag deletion, with no bypass actor (Section 40.1,
   line 3675, D107).

## Deployment operations

Accepted deviation: this repository uses `make deploy` and `make restore` for deployment operations (Q14=B). See `docs/decisions/D-L4-P3-03.md`.

## What lane L4 does not configure

L4 declares; it does not configure GitHub. The protection posture this repository requires is
recorded in `PROTECTION-REQUEST.md` for L0. No file exists under `.github/` here until charter
decision **D-L4-03** resolves.

## Commit signing

The records-writer signs every commit it makes on the default branch, and a default-branch
commit that is unsigned or signed by another identity is Blocking drift (Section 40.1,
line 3676). Configuring that identity is a credential matter, not something this file or any
L4 script performs.

## 8. What Phase 3 hands to the other lanes

| Artifact | Consumer | Consumed as |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/records/dispatch/rvr-inputs.yaml` | **L2** | The `workflow_dispatch` `inputs:` block of the RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT workflow L2 owns under `.github/workflows/` |
| `tools/records/record-verification-result` | **L2** | The handler that workflow calls |
| `tools/records/dispatch/deploy-steps.yaml` | **L2** | The eight required, failing steps `deploy-production.yml` must run (§97.2, line 8867) |
| `tools/records/deploy-emit` | **L2** | The emitter those steps call |
| `tools/records/dispatch/board-events.yaml`, `board-emit`, `rqm-emit` | **L2** | The board-automation emission surface |
| `tools/records/write-paths.yaml` | **L3** | The declared writer per store, beside the write-freshness windows the §53.1 drift row (line 4671) compares against |
| `tools/records/validate-human-record.sh`, `validate-write-paths.sh`, `validate-board-events.sh` | **L0** | Status checks for the gate |
| `control-plane-records/CONTRIBUTING.md` | everyone | The human lane, and the D-L4-P3-02 open question |

## 9. Standing rules — this phase only

The lane charter's §12 applies in full. Four rules bind this phase in particular:

1. **`emit.sh` is the only writer.** No task in this phase, and no later task, writes a file under `records/` or `events/` by any other means. Two writers for one store is the divergence §97.1 line 8838 exists to prevent.
2. **A record and its event are one commit.** `emit_pair` writes both or neither (§97.2, line 8871). Never call `emit_record` alone from an emitter.
3. **Never invent an `event_type`.** §97.3 line 8947 makes a new identifier a governed addition to the enum in `registries/platform.yaml`, which is L1's file (charter §3.1). An identifier that fails `validate-board-events.sh` is a blocker for L0, never a taxonomy edit.
4. **Never weaken a required failing step.** `continue-on-error`, `|| true` and `set +e` are absent from every emitter by design (§97.2, line 8867). Restoring a green build by adding one converts a Blocking evidence failure into an invisible one — the exact failure mode §99.6 risk 2 (lines 9276–9294) names.
