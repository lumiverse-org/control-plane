# L4-05 — PHASE 5: INGEST AND WORK TRACKING

**Lane:** L4 — Records, Events and Metrics. Subsystems **I** (Metrics pipeline) and **N** (Work tracking conventions) — Master Spec §99.2, lines 9196 and 9201.
**Phase:** 5 — the ingest half of subsystem I, and the board/horizon/Ready half of subsystem N.
**Branch prefix:** `lane/4/05-*` — one branch per task, `PARTITION.md` line 34.
**Task ids:** `L4-P5-01`…`L4-P5-04` (work tracking, already indexed as rows 66–69 of `L4-06-tasks.md` §2) and `L4-P5-14`…`L4-P5-24` (ingest, added by this file).
**Authority order:** `PARTITION.md` (FROZEN) > `MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` > `L4-00-charter.md` > `L4-06-tasks.md` > this file. Where this file appears to differ from `PARTITION.md`, `PARTITION.md` wins and the difference is a blocker for L0.
**Spec of record:** `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` (10,214 lines). Every line number below was located with `grep`/`sed` and is cited, not inferred.

## 1. Why this phase exists

Two rows of the §99.2 build-surface table, verbatim:

> **I | Metrics pipeline |** *"DevLake nightly ingest; Prometheus scraping `/health`, `/version`, `/metrics`; Scorecard scheduled scan with drop detection; the event-log taxonomy; attention ledger; metric source discipline"* — line 9196
>
> **N | Work tracking conventions |** *"Boards per product plus portfolio aggregate (or the single-Project fallback), horizon semantics, Ready-to-Execute definition, automatic Ready-queue-miss recording"* — line 9201

Phases 3 and 4 built the taxonomy and the writers. Phase 6 builds the attention ledger. **Phase 5 builds the two halves those phases do not touch: what the machine instruments are allowed to feed the metric layer, and what a board column means.**

Three spec obligations are discharged here and nowhere else:

| Obligation | Spec anchor |
|---|---|
| DevLake connector field coverage is an **unverified capability assumption**, *"confirmed before the phase depending on it"*, and is a named dependency of Phase G3 | §30.3 line 2737; §99.3 item 4, line 9243; §98 Phase G3, line 9133 |
| The three runtime endpoints are *"the entire runtime interface the operating system requires of a served product"*, are **not a public surface**, and are scraped over the private path with a per-product scrape credential | §41.2, lines 3719–3728 |
| An item is Ready only on **all ten** criteria, and a banded estimate is captured at Ready confirmation for normal planned work only (D79) | §29.3, lines 2655–2666; D79, line 10162 |

And one rule binds every task in the file — **metric source discipline**, invariant 46 (§101.7, line 9513):

> *"Derived data is computed, never hand-maintained. Metrics derive from the canonical record stores of Section 97 (Records, Events and Data Conventions), never from hand-maintained numbers."*

restated at the §103 preamble (line 9776): *"Every metric derives from the canonical record stores and event log of Section 97 — never from hand-maintained numbers."*

DevLake, Prometheus and Scorecard are **not** §97 record stores. §103.1 and §103.2 nonetheless name DevLake in a column headed *"Source (record store)"* (lines 9782, 9787 and 9794). That is the tension this phase resolves mechanically, in `L4-P5-22`, and it is why the collector declarations are built before the register that reads them.

---

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Paths this phase writes — nothing else

| Repository | Path | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `control-plane` | `metrics/boards/**` | `L4-P5-01`…`L4-P5-03` |
| `control-plane` | `metrics/ingest/**` | `L4-P5-14`…`L4-P5-23` |
| `control-plane` | `tools/records/boards/**`, `tools/records/ingest/**` | limb modules |
| `control-plane` | `tools/records/validate-boards.sh`, `tools/records/validate-ingest.sh`, `tools/records/estimate_capture.py` | dispatchers and the D79 capture point |
| `control-plane` | `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-*.sh` | one new file per task, §0.4 |

`metrics/**` and `tools/records/**` are L4-owned by `PARTITION.md` line 20. Nothing in `control-plane-records` is written by this phase.

### 2.2 Explicitly NOT in scope

| Item | Owner | Why, with citation |
|---|---|---|
| The Ready-queue-miss detector — `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` | L4, elsewhere | Already indexed as rows 70–78 of `L4-06-tasks.md` §2, with acceptance criteria `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` in its Phase 5 table and charter DoD-8. **This file does not restate them and must not renumber them.** The `metrics/boards/**` files built here are the detector's input. |
| Installing DevLake, Prometheus, Grafana or Scorecard; the compose file; the required database engine | L5 (subsystem M) | §99.2 line 9200 places the operations VM in subsystem M; `PARTITION.md` line 21 gives `ops-vm/**` to L5. `L4-06-tasks.md` §7 already routes *"Grafana dashboards, DevLake ingest configuration, Prometheus scrape configuration"* out of L4. |
| Every Grafana surface that reads these declarations | **no lane** | Subsystem H (§99.2 line 9195) is assigned to no lane in `PARTITION.md` v1. See **DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P5-03**. |
| `registries/os-health.yaml` (the metric register) and `registries/economics.yaml` (the estimate band vocabulary) | L1 | `PARTITION.md` line 17. L4 **reads** them and **publishes content for** them; it never writes them. Charter `D-L4-02`. |
| The §103 measure computations and the register itself | L4 Phase 7 | `L4-P7-01`…`L4-P7-14`. This phase publishes `metrics/ingest/source-kinds.yaml` as their input. |
| Any `.github/workflows/**` file that schedules a nightly ingest | L2 | `PARTITION.md` line 18. |

### 2.3 The one paragraph that keeps this phase honest

L4 **declares**; L5 **installs**; H **renders**. Every artifact in this phase is a declaration file plus a validator that proves the declaration is internally consistent and spec-conformant. No task in this phase connects to DevLake, scrapes an endpoint, or runs a Scorecard scan from a lane branch. The three tasks that need a live system are marked **ASSISTED** (§3) and produce a request document and an evidence template, never an executed session.

---

## 3. Execution modes — and the ASSISTED rule

| Mode | Who executes | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **LANE** | you, the Sonnet-4.6-class executor | Every command in the task is runnable from a lane branch with no credential beyond `gh auth` on `control-plane`. |
| **ASSISTED** | **L0 human lead**, after you prepare | Requires a credential, a console session or a host a low-cost agent must not hold. You produce the request artifact and the evidence template only, then **stop and hand off**. |

This is the same two-mode split `L5-06-tasks.md` §1 uses; the wording is deliberately identical so the two lanes read the same way to the same executor.

**You never execute an ASSISTED task's console steps.** You produce its artifact, commit it, and open the handoff issue. If you find yourself about to type a DevLake admin password, a Prometheus scrape credential, an SSH session into the operations VM, or a GitHub organisation-owner URL — **stop; it is ASSISTED.**

### 3.1 The three ASSISTED tasks of this phase

| Task | What it needs that you must not hold |
|---|---|
| `L4-P5-17` | DevLake admin console or API on the operations VM, plus the connector's configured GitHub token — to enumerate which connector fields actually land (§99.3 item 4, line 9243) |
| `L4-P5-19` | An SSH session on the operations VM and the per-product scrape credential — to prove the three endpoints answer over the private path and are unreachable publicly (§41.2 line 3726; §19.2 line 1892) |
| `L4-P5-21` | A GitHub organisation-owner session — to confirm Scorecard behaviour against **private** repositories and to run the baseline scan (§30.3 line 2737; §98 Phase 2, line 9029) |

**ASSISTED evidence rule.** You never author the evidence file. The human pastes it; your validator reads it. A validator that passes on an evidence file you wrote is not a check (`L4-06-tasks.md` §0.8 rule 9).

---

## 4. Reader contract

You are executing, not designing. Every command is literal and copy-pasteable. Run them in **Git Bash** (POSIX `sh`), not `cmd.exe` or PowerShell. If any step requires you to choose, name, invent or interpret something not written here, **STOP** and file the blocker of §0.5. Do not guess. Do not substitute a similar command. Do not relax a failing acceptance check.

### 0.1 Workspace — export before every task

The shell resets between calls. Re-export these at the start of **every** task. Always use absolute paths.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/contracts/project-config.sh"
check_org
export CP_REPO="control-plane"
export CP_SLUG="${ORG}/${CP_REPO}"
export WORK="$HOME/l4work"
export CP_DIR="${WORK}/${CP_REPO}"
export L4_VENV="C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Code/.l4-venv"
L4_PY="$L4_VENV/Scripts/python.exe"; [ -x "$L4_PY" ] || L4_PY="$L4_VENV/bin/python"
export L4_PY
export SPEC="C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md"
echo "CP_DIR=$CP_DIR L4_PY=$L4_PY"
```

`$L4_VENV` is the virtualenv fixed by `L4-02-record-schemas.md` §3.2 — **outside both repositories, never committed**. `$WORK`/`$CP_DIR` are fixed by `L4-06-tasks.md` §0.1. Both conventions already exist in this lane; this file adopts them and creates no third one.

If `ORG` prints as the literal placeholder, **STOP** — `D-L4-TL-5` has not been answered.

### 0.2 Path ownership (hard)

In `control-plane` you may create or edit files **only** under `schemas/records/**`, `metrics/**`, `tools/records/**`. You may read anything. A pull request touching a foreign path fails the lane-guard check (`PARTITION.md` rule 1, line 25). Run `bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths` before every commit and every push.

**Namespace-package rule** (`L4-06-tasks.md` §0.2): do **not** create `tools/__init__.py` or `schemas/__init__.py`. Every limb module in this phase is invoked **by file path** (`"$L4_PY" tools/records/boards/columns.py`), never by import, so no package file is ever needed.

**No shared mutable file, ever** (`PARTITION.md` rule 3). One file per collector, one file per board concept, one file per task check. No task appends to an index.

### 0.3 Deterministic output contract

Inherited verbatim from `L4-06-tasks.md` §0.5. Every executable this phase ships prints exactly one final line on stdout and sets its exit code from this table:

```
<NAME> OK <counters>        exit 0    the assertion held
<NAME> FAIL <counters>      exit 1    the module executed and the assertion did not hold
<NAME> ERROR <reason>       exit 3    the module could not execute (missing input, unreachable source)
```

Exit `3` is never a pass. A check that cannot reach its input **fails closed** (§40.1 line 3671). Any exit code other than 0, 1 or 3 is a crash and is a STOP.

`<NAME>` is `BOARDS` for `validate-boards.sh` and `INGEST` for `validate-ingest.sh`. Those two strings are frozen; changing either breaks the phase sweep of §10.

### 0.4 The universal SELF-VERIFY

`tools/records/check.sh` is the fixed dispatcher built in `L4-P2-01` (`L4-06-tasks.md` §0.6). **Every task in this file contributes exactly one new file `tools/records/checks/<TASK-ID>.sh`** — a new file, never an edit to a shared one. After the task's acceptance command passes and before you commit:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR" && bash tools/records/check.sh <TASK-ID>; echo "exit=$?"
```

**Expected output, exactly two lines, nothing else:**

```
CHECK <TASK-ID> PASS
exit=0
```

Any other output — `FAIL`, `ERROR`, a different exit, extra lines — is a STOP.

### 0.5 STOP rule and blocker template

**Standing STOP rule.** Stop, commit nothing, and file the blocker below if: the task's stated STOP condition occurs; any command errors in a way the task does not describe; a file you must edit is outside §0.2; the universal SELF-VERIFY prints anything other than the two expected lines; a spec fact you need is not written in this file; or the task would require you to design, choose or interpret anything. Do not guess, do not substitute, do not work around, do not proceed to the next task.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
gh issue create --repo "${CP_SLUG}" --title "BLOCKER <TASK-ID>: <one-line symptom>" --label blocker,lane-4 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
blocked_task: <TASK-ID>
lane: 4
phase: 5
branch: lane/4/05-<task-slug>
repo: control-plane
stop_condition_hit: <quote the STOP line from L4-05-pipeline-and-boards.md verbatim>
command_run: |
  <the exact command, copy-pasted>
observed_output: |
  <paste verbatim, do not summarise, do not redact anything except credentials>
expected_output: |
  <paste the SELF-VERIFY expected block verbatim>
files_touched_so_far: <exact paths, or "none">
state_left_behind: <branch pushed? commit made? or "none">
what_i_did_NOT_do: <the remaining steps of the task>
decision_required_from: L0
EOF
)"
```

Then take the next **unblocked** task, or idle. Never work around a blocker.

### 0.6 The standing git wrapper — every task, no exceptions

Open every task with:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR"
git fetch origin
git checkout integration
git pull --ff-only origin integration
git checkout -b lane/4/05-<task-slug>
```

Close every task, after its acceptance command **and** its SELF-VERIFY pass:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR"
bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths
git add <the exact files named in the task's Writes line>
git commit -m "<TASK-ID>: <task title>"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration
git push -u origin lane/4/05-<task-slug>
gh pr create --base integration \
  --title "<TASK-ID>: <task title>" \
  --body "Lane 4, Phase 5. Task <TASK-ID>. Acceptance command in L4-05-pipeline-and-boards.md passed."
```

Each task below repeats these blocks with the slug and file list already filled in. Copy them as written. **Never merge or rebase another lane's branch** (`PARTITION.md` line 36).

### 0.7 Task index

Sizes: **S** under 1 hour, **M** 1–4 hours, **L** over 4 hours. No task spans a day.

**Ids `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` are deliberately absent from this file.** They are the Ready-queue-miss detector, indexed as rows 70–78 of `L4-06-tasks.md` §2. Do not create them here and do not renumber this file to close the gap.

---

## 5. Phase entry conditions

`L4-P5-01` proves rows E1–E5; `L4-P5-14` proves rows E6–E8. If any row fails, no task depending on it starts. **Do not create another phase's artifact to make a row pass.**

| # | Condition | Owner | Verify command | Required by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | `$CP_DIR` is a git checkout of `control-plane` with an `integration` branch | L0 / L1 | `git -C "$CP_DIR" rev-parse --verify origin/integration` | every task |
| E2 | `tools/records/check.sh` exists and prints `CHECK X ERROR no-check-file` for an unknown id | `L4-P2-01` | `bash tools/records/check.sh ZZZ; echo "exit=$?"` | every task |
| E3 | `tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh` exists and is executable | charter `L4-T005` | `test -x tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh` | every task |
| E4 | `$L4_PY` runs and can `import yaml` | `L4-P2-02` | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml,sys;print(sys.version.split()[0])"` | every task |
| E5 | `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml` exists | `L4-P3-01` | `test -f metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml` | `L4-P5-01` |
| E6 | `metrics/signals/sig-source-map.yaml` exists | `L4-P3-06` | `test -f metrics/signals/sig-source-map.yaml` | `L4-P5-14` |
| E7 | `schemas/records/estimate.schema.json` exists and requires both `elapsed` and `elapsed_net_blocked` | `L4-P2-10` | `"$L4_PY" -c "import json;d=json.load(open('schemas/records/estimate.schema.json'));r=set(d['required']);print('OK' if {'elapsed','elapsed_net_blocked'}<=r else 'MISSING')"` | `L4-P5-04` |
| E8 | `metrics/retention/retention-classes.yaml` exists | `L4-P3-07` | `test -f metrics/retention/retention-classes.yaml` | `L4-P5-23` |

If E5, E6, E7 or E8 fail, the phase that owns them has not merged to `integration`. **Do not create them here.** File the blocker naming the condition id.

---

## 6. DECISION REQUIRED — hand to L0. No L4 executor answers these.

Five questions. Each names a **stated default that ships if no answer arrives**, so no task in this phase is blocked on an answer. The `D-L4-P5-*` namespace is used to avoid the id collision recorded as `D-L4-TL-2`.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P5-01 — Scorecard scan results name no §97 record store

- **Fact.** §101.7 invariant 46 (line 9513) and the §103 preamble (line 9776) require every metric to derive from a canonical §97 record store. `grep -n "records/" MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` over the §97.2 store table (lines 8845–8869) returns **no** Scorecard store, and §52.2 (lines 4530–4576) carries **no** `SIG-` row whose source is Scorecard. Yet §92.3 line 8300 requires a Scorecard drop to arrive *"either as a decision prompt … or as an owned line on the Reliability dimension"*, and §19.2 line 1896 makes *"Scorecard at or above the declared minimum; no unresolved high findings"* a launch-readiness row.
- **Question.** Does a `records/scorecard/` store get added by a §97.2 table amendment, or does the Scorecard drop route to an existing store (and which), or does it remain a collector-only surface exempt from invariant 46?
- **L4 default that ships:** `metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml` declares `source_kind: collector` and `source_store: PENDING-D-L4-P5-01`. `L4-P5-22`'s validator asserts the placeholder is **present**, not that it is resolved. The drop-detection measure therefore renders `unarmed — not yet instrumented` under D77 (§52.2 line 4524) and **cannot render as a miss**.
- **L4 must not:** create a `records/scorecard/` directory, add a store to `schemas/records/`, or route a Scorecard result into an existing store by resemblance.
- **Blocks:** nothing. Binding a store later is a `metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml` field edit, not a rewrite.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P5-02 — "drop" has no declared magnitude

- **Fact.** §92.3 line 8300 says *"A Scorecard score drop"* and §17.3 line 1771 says *"Expect a Scorecard drop to remediate"*. Neither states how large a decrease is a drop, nor over what window. `security.scorecard_minimum` (§15.1, initial value `7.0`) is a **floor**, which is a different condition from a decrease.
- **Question.** What magnitude and window define a reportable drop, and does crossing `scorecard_minimum` route differently from a decrease above it?
- **L4 default that ships:** two separately named conditions, both literal readings of the two cited lines — `decrease`: any strictly negative delta against the previous recorded scan for that product; `below_minimum`: the new score is below that product's declared `security.scorecard_minimum`. Both are declared; `metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml` records `routing_threshold: any_decrease` (D-L4-P5-02 decided).
- **Blocks:** nothing.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P5-03 — subsystem H, and the installation side of subsystem M, have no lane

- **Fact.** `PARTITION.md` §"The five build lanes" (lines 15–22) assigns subsystems A, B, C, D, E, F, I, K, L, M, N, Q, R. **G, H, J, O and P are assigned to no lane.** Subsystem **H** (§99.2 line 9195) is *"Dashboards and views | Grafana provisioned from JSON in git: every surface of Section 92"*, and its declared dependency list is `I, F, C` — it consumes exactly what this phase publishes. Separately, `PARTITION.md` line 21 gives `ops-vm/**` to L5, so the **installation** of DevLake, Prometheus and Scorecard is L5's, while their **declarations** are L4's.
- **Question.** Which lane owns subsystem H, and what is the handoff mechanism from `metrics/ingest/**` (L4) to the Grafana JSON (H) and to the collector configuration on the operations VM (L5)?
- **L4 default that ships:** this phase publishes declarations only, and `metrics/ingest/README.md` names the consumers as *"L5 for installation (`ops-vm/**`), subsystem H for rendering — H unassigned in PARTITION v1"*. L4 opens no Grafana file and no `ops-vm/**` file.
- **L4 must not:** claim subsystem H, write a dashboard JSON, or write anything under `ops-vm/**`.
- **Blocks:** nothing in this phase. It blocks anyone who expects a chart at the end of it.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P5-04 — the designated work-management system, and which board mode is selected

- **Fact.** §29.1 line 2625 says boards live *"in the designated work-management system"*. §29.1 line 2635 states the implementation dependency verbatim: *"confirm aggregation and filtering capability at the plan tier in use before Phase 1 of implementation … If aggregation is unavailable, the fallback is a single organisation-level project containing all items with a product field, and per-product filtered views — one board, many views, rather than many boards plus a manual roll-up."* That confirmation is a console action against a live plan tier; no executor can perform it from a lane branch.
- **Question.** Which system, which plan tier, and — after the confirmation — is `selected_mode` `aggregated` or `single_project_fallback`?
- **L4 default that ships:** `metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml` declares **both** modes in full, sets `selected_mode: single_project_fallback` (D-L4-P5-04 decided) and `aggregation_confirmed: false`. `validate-boards.sh --columns` asserts both modes are declared and the mode is answered. Nothing downstream in this phase branches on the mode.
- **L4 must not:** pick a mode, name a vendor, or create a board.
- **Blocks:** nothing in this phase.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P5-05 — how an item is marked spike, incident or debt-remediation for the estimate exemption

- **Fact.** §29.3 line 2667 (D79): *"Normal planned work records an estimate band … spikes, incidents and debt-remediation items are exempt."* The three exempt classes are named in prose. No field on any board item, in any registry schema, or in §97.2 carries them: `grep -n "debt-remediation" MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` returns line 2665 and nothing else.
- **Question.** What field on a board item carries the item class, and what is its closed vocabulary?
- **L4 default that ships:** `metrics/boards/ready-definition.yaml` declares `estimate_exempt_classes: [spike, incident, debt-remediation]` — the three literal §29.3 words — and `tools/records/estimate_capture.py` **requires** the caller to pass `--item-class`. It **never infers the class**, and a call with no `--item-class` exits `3` (`ERROR missing-item-class`), never `0`.
- **L4 must not:** infer the class from a title, a label, a linked incident record, or a column.
- **Blocks:** nothing. The caller is board automation, which is subsystem N's write path and reaches `estimate_capture.py` through the `machine-board` class of `L4-03-write-paths.md` §3.1.

---

## 7. Normative tables — transcribed, not summarised

Every task below writes one of these tables into a file. Where a task's YAML and a table here differ, **the table is authoritative and the difference is a blocker for L0.**

### 7.1 The flow — §29.1, line 2628, exactly seven columns in this order

```
Backlog → Ready → Planned → In Progress → In Review → Verify → Done
```

*"Backlog and Ready are not the same thing. This distinction is load-bearing."* — line 2631.

### 7.2 The two states that are not columns — §29.1, line 2632

| State | Kind | Applies to | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Blocked** | flag | Planned, In Progress, In Review, Verify — *"any in-flight column"* | Flagged items surface in the by-blocked-state view. **Never a column.** |
| **Deploy** | post-merge pipeline stage | — | *"rendered on the board from deployment records (Section 32) so that an item's position between merge and shipped is visible; nobody moves a card into it by hand."* |

### 7.3 Board topology — §29.1, lines 2633–2635

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Product board | One per product. **Execution truth.** |
| Portfolio board | One aggregate view across all products, *"derived from product boards wherever the projects platform supports aggregation"*. **An aggregated planning and capacity view, not execution truth.** *"Nobody maintains duplicate cards by hand."* |
| Portfolio views (line 2634, ten, verbatim) | current work · ready work · future work · by owner · by reviewer · by product · by priority · by blocked state · by lifecycle status · by impact scope |
| Fallback if aggregation is unavailable (line 2635) | *"a single organisation-level project containing all items with a product field, and per-product filtered views — one board, many views, rather than many boards plus a manual roll-up"* |
| Queue of record (line 2639, D70) | The boards of §29.1 only. The background worker harness's internal dispatch queue *"is never a work surface, never rendered or exposed as a board, and never execution truth."* |

### 7.4 The three horizons — §29.2, lines 2645–2649

| Horizon | Contains | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H1 — Current** | The in-flight flow columns — Planned, In Progress, In Review, Verify — plus the Deploy pipeline stage and any item carrying the Blocked flag | **Committed** | Developers |
| **H2 — Ready Next** | Prepared work that can start immediately when capacity opens | **Prepared**, not committed | Team Lead |
| **H3 — Future** | Major features, technical debt, migrations, architecture evolution, customer requests, security work, integrations, platform upgrades, lifecycle decisions | **Candidate**, intentionally flexible | Team Lead |

Line 2649: *"Work that enters H1 without H2 preparation carries the `unplanned` flag in the attention taxonomy (Section 67)."* Line 2651: *"The Founder does not rearrange individual developer tasks"*; routine Founder priority changes are recorded as a decision record referenced by the affected H2 and H3 items.

### 7.5 The ten Ready criteria — §29.3, line 2655, verbatim and in order

| # | Criterion |
|---|---|
| 1 | a clear requirement |
| 2 | the product identified |
| 3 | a priority |
| 4 | an intended person |
| 5 | a verification path |
| 6 | dependencies understood |
| 7 | required architecture decisions resolved |
| 8 | impact scope proposed |
| 9 | acceptance criteria |
| 10 | enough context to begin GSD discussion immediately |

*"An item is Ready **only when** it has"* all ten. Missing one is not Ready.

The pipeline of line 2658–2659: `Idea → Defined → Verification understood → Architecture resolved → Ready → Assigned → Executed`.

Four further §29.3 rules, all declared in `ready-definition.yaml`:

| Rule | Line |
|---|---|
| Two Ready items per developer is the **normal planning target, not an absolute invariant**; a large architecture item legitimately occupying someone for weeks with nothing queued is correct behaviour, not a planning miss | 2662 |
| The hard requirement is that **Ready-queue misses trend to zero**; do not fragment tasks artificially to satisfy a numeric queue count | 2663 |
| **Ready-draft delegation** — Primary Owners may draft Ready candidates for their own products; the Team Lead's confirmation is the Ready transition. Authorship is delegated; Ready authority is retained | 2664 |
| Item selection among equal-priority Ready items is the developer's own choice | 2666 |

### 7.6 Estimate capture — §29.3 line 2665 (D79, line 10162)

| Element | Value |
|---|---|
| Capture point | **Ready confirmation.** The single capture point feeding the estimates store and the estimation-accuracy KPIs. |
| Applies to | Normal planned work only |
| Exempt | spikes, incidents, debt-remediation items |
| Form | **Banded**, matching the collection philosophy, **never hours-precise** |
| Vocabulary home | *"calibrated configuration declared in `economics.yaml`"* — **L1's file** (`PARTITION.md` line 17). L4 reads it; L4 never writes it. |
| Initial calibration (line 2665) | `XS` half a day · `S` one day · `M` three days · `L` five days · `XL` ten days and a prompt to split the item |
| Recorded on the record | the band **label** *and* the point value **in force when it was written**, *"so a later revision of the vocabulary re-maps the history rather than invalidating it"* |
| Actual effort | **elapsed net of recorded Blocked time** for the §78 Estimation Accuracy KPI; **raw elapsed** for forecast calibration; *"the record carries both figures so the two are never confused"* |

### 7.7 The three collectors of subsystem I — §99.2 line 9196

| Collector | Cadence, with anchor | What it produces |
|---|---|---|
| **DevLake** | Nightly. §94.2 clock: ingestion **04:00**, *"DevLake refresh complete"* **06:00** (lines 8409, 8411) | PR cycle time, cross-review turnaround, lead time merge-to-production (§103.1, §103.2); SIG-04, SIG-07, SIG-08 and — with registries — SIG-40 (§52.2 lines 4533, 4536, 4537, 4569) |
| **Prometheus** | Scrapes the three §41.2 endpoints. **Interval is set in the operations-VM Prometheus configuration (subsystem M, L5 `ops-vm/**`) and is not declared by L4** — §38.4 line 3476 refers to *"a scrape interval"* and names no value | Liveness and dependency health, deployed digest, product metrics including AI token and spend counters |
| **Scorecard** | Nightly. §94.2 clock: *"Scorecard full scan"* **02:00** (line 8406); §84.4 tool cadence table: *"Scorecard \| Nightly \| Risk score per product \| Free"* (line 8561) | Risk score per product (§85.2 line 8395) |

### 7.8 The three required endpoints — §41.2, lines 3723–3725, verbatim

| Endpoint | Provides |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness plus dependency health, distinguishing internal from external failure |
| `GET /version` | Deployed artifact digest and build metadata |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus format |

Binding conditions, all from §41.2:

| Condition | Line |
|---|---|
| Required of every product whose declared `conformance_profile` exposes the service interface — *"the `service` default, and `white-label` per deployment"*. A product declaring `client-app`, `library`, `batch`, `customer-hosted` or `static-site` *"meets the equivalent evidence of Section 15.7 instead, and is never failed for lacking an endpoint its shape cannot serve"* | 3719 |
| *"The three endpoints are not a public surface."* Each product declares `observability.telemetry_exposure`; **the estate's declared posture is `private-authenticated`** — reachable only over the private path from the operations VM, with a **per-product scrape credential**. `public` is a recorded Founder decision, never a framework default | 3726 |
| *"The private path is a scrape path only — it carries the operations VM no production credential, no deploy key and no environment access"* | 3726 |
| *"`/version` closes the production evidence chain … the digest it reports must equal the approved digest, and any mismatch is a P0 investigation"* | 3728 |
| Every AI-consuming product exports cumulative tokens and estimated spend per provider key through `/metrics`, and Prometheus alerts at `cost.metrics_alert_fraction` — **initial calibrated value 0.8** | 3476 |
| Launch readiness: *"`observability.telemetry_exposure` declared, and `/metrics` verified unreachable from the public internet unless a recorded Founder decision declares it `public`"* | 1892 |

### 7.9 The DevLake field-coverage caveat — §99.3 item 4, line 9243, verbatim

> **DevLake field coverage** — several metrics (routine reviews absorbed cross-checked against the routing table, reviewer familiarity, reviewer-spread measures) require bespoke computation beyond DevLake's models; **confirm coverage before Phase G3**.

Reinforced twice more:

- §30.3 line 2737: *"Other tools carry unverified capability assumptions, each confirmed before the phase depending on it: … **DevLake's connector field coverage and required database engine** …"*
- §98 Phase G3, line 9133: *"Dependencies: G1–G2; **DevLake field coverage confirmed.**"*

**The rule this phase makes mechanical:** a measure declaring `source_kind: collector` and `collector: devlake` may not arm until `metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml` records a confirmation for the field it needs. Until then it renders `unarmed — not yet instrumented` under D77 (§52.2 line 4524) — **never as a miss, never as zero**.

### 7.10 The three arming strings — frozen vocabulary

Only these three strings may appear in an `arming_state` field anywhere in `metrics/ingest/**`. They are transcribed from §52.2 line 4524 and §51.2 line 4459; no fourth string is invented.

| String | Meaning | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `unarmed — not yet instrumented` | The declared source is not live | §52.2, line 4524 |
| `unarmed — insufficient history` | The source is live but does not yet hold the full `lookback_window` | §52.2, line 4524 |
| `armed — source stale` | The source is live and holds the window, but its ingest is past its freshness bound | §51.2, line 4459 |

Line 4459, verbatim, is the only stated freshness SLO for any collector in this phase: *"DevLake ingest freshness \| Ingest completes at least daily \| Age of the newest ingested row \| Amber; the signals sourced from DevLake render as **armed — source stale** (Section 52.2) rather than as within tolerance"*.

---

## 8. Tasks — subsystem N, work tracking conventions

These four are rows 66–69 of `L4-06-tasks.md` §2. Their ids, file paths, sizes, dependencies and acceptance commands are taken from that index unchanged.

**RESOLVED ORDERING — do not re-litigate.** `L4-06-tasks.md` row 68 lists `tools/records/validate-boards.sh` among `L4-P5-03`'s files, while rows 66 and 67 already verify with `validate-boards.sh --columns` and `--horizons`. The dispatcher is therefore **created** in `L4-P5-01` and **extended** by later limbs. Editing a file inside an owned path is permitted (`PARTITION.md` rule 5); creating it twice is not. Every limb is its own file under `tools/records/boards/`, so rule 3 holds.

---

### TASK `L4-P5-01` — Board conventions: seven columns, Blocked as a flag, Deploy rendered

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P3-01` · **Spec** §29.1 lines 2623–2639; D70
**Writes** `metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml`, `tools/records/validate-boards.sh`, `tools/records/boards/columns.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-01.sh`

§7.1, §7.2 and §7.3 become one file. Line 2631 is why the check counts columns rather than trusting a set: *"Backlog and Ready are not the same thing. This distinction is load-bearing."* A configuration that collapses them, or that promotes Blocked to a column, is the erosion the check exists to catch.

#### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous expected output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The limb passes with the frozen counters | `bash tools/records/validate-boards.sh --columns` | `BOARDS OK columns=7 inflight=4 nonstate=2 views=10 modes=2` |
| 2 | Exactly seven flow columns, in §29.1 order | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;print('/'.join(yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml'))['flow_columns']))"` | `Backlog/Ready/Planned/In Progress/In Review/Verify/Done` |
| 3 | Blocked is a flag, not a column | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;b=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml'))['non_column_states']['Blocked'];print(b['kind'],b['is_column'])"` | `flag False` |
| 4 | Deploy is rendered, never hand-moved | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;x=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml'))['non_column_states']['Deploy'];print(x['rendered_from'],x['hand_moved'])"` | `records/deployments/ False` |
| 5 | Ten portfolio views | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;print(len(yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml'))['board_topology']['portfolio_board']['views']))"` | `10` |
| 6 | Both modes declared; mode selected | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;d=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml'));print(len(d['aggregation_modes']),d['selected_mode'])"` | `2 single_project_fallback` |
| 7 | The check **can fail** (§0.8 rule 9) | `cp metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml /tmp/bc.bak && "$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;p='metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml';d=yaml.safe_load(open(p));d['flow_columns'].remove('Ready');yaml.safe_dump(d,open(p,'w'))" && bash tools/records/validate-boards.sh --columns; echo "exit=$?"; cp /tmp/bc.bak metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml` | `BOARDS FAIL columns flow-columns-not-the-seven-of-line-2628` then `exit=1` |
| 8 | Nothing outside the owned paths | `bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths` | `PATHS OK` |

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR" && bash tools/records/check.sh L4-P5-01; echo "exit=$?"
```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

```
CHECK L4-P5-01 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-02` if:

- Criterion 7 does not print `BOARDS FAIL` — a check that cannot fail is not a check (`L4-06-tasks.md` §0.8 rule 9). Blocker.
- `lane-selfcheck.sh --paths` reports anything but `PATHS OK`. Blocker.
- `metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml` already exists on `integration` → a prior partial run. Do **not** overwrite it and do **not** delete it. Blocker.

#### Close the task

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR"
bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths
git add metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml tools/records/validate-boards.sh tools/records/boards/columns.py tools/records/checks/L4-P5-01.sh
git commit -m "L4-P5-01: Board conventions - seven columns, Blocked as a flag, Deploy rendered"
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/integration
git push -u origin lane/4/05-board-conventions
gh pr create --base integration --title "L4-P5-01: Board conventions" \
  --body "Lane 4, Phase 5. Task L4-P5-01. Acceptance command in L4-05-pipeline-and-boards.md passed."

### TASK `L4-P5-03` — Ready-to-Execute definition as machine-checkable configuration

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-01` · **Spec** §29.3 lines 2653–2666
**Writes** `metrics/boards/ready-definition.yaml`, `tools/records/boards/ready.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-03.sh`

§7.5 becomes one file. Line 2655 says an item is Ready *"only when it has"* the ten. The check asserts the conjunction is `all`, because "nine of ten and it is nearly Ready" is exactly the erosion that would make the Ready-queue-miss detector of `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` meaningless.

Two rules must **not** become numeric gates: the two-items-per-developer target (line 2662) is declared `is_absolute_invariant: false`, and line 2663 forbids artificial fragmentation to satisfy a queue count.

### TASK `L4-P5-04` — Estimate capture at Ready confirmation (D79)

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-03`, `L4-P2-10` · **Spec** §29.3 line 2665; D79 line 10162; §97.2 line 8850
**Writes** `tools/records/estimate_capture.py`, `tools/records/fixtures/estimate-capture/*.json`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-04.sh`

§7.6 becomes one callable. Four rules make this task non-negotiable:

1. **One capture point.** Line 2665: *"This is the single capture point feeding the estimates store and the estimation-accuracy KPIs (D79)."* Firing anywhere but the Ready-confirmation transition is a defect, not a convenience.
2. **The vocabulary is L1's.** *"The band vocabulary is calibrated configuration declared in `economics.yaml`"* — `PARTITION.md` line 17 gives `registries/**` to L1. This module **reads** that file and **fails closed** if it cannot (§40.1 line 3671). It never writes it and never embeds a fallback vocabulary.
3. **Label and point value together.** The record carries *"the band label and the point value in force when it was written, so a later revision of the vocabulary re-maps the history rather than invalidating it."*
4. **Two elapsed figures, never one.** *"The quantity the Estimation Accuracy KPI (Section 78) calls actual effort is elapsed net of recorded Blocked time; raw elapsed is what forecast calibration uses, and the record carries both figures so the two are never confused."* `L4-P2-10` already made `elapsed` and `elapsed_net_blocked` two required, distinct fields on `estimate.schema.json`; this module never emits one without the other's key present.

The exemption is `D-L4-P5-05`: `--item-class` is **required** and never inferred.

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash

```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

CHECK L4-P5-04 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-14` if:

- `registries/economics.yaml` is absent or declares no `estimate_bands` → L1 has not published the vocabulary. The module printing `ESTIMATE ERROR economics-unreachable` is **correct behaviour**; criterion 1 still passes because the self-test does not read it. **Do not create `registries/economics.yaml`** — it is L1's path (`PARTITION.md` line 17) and writing it fails the lane guard. File the blocker naming `registries/economics.yaml`, and record in it the §29.3 initial calibration L1 must carry: `XS` half a day, `S` one day, `M` three days, `L` five days, `XL` ten days and a prompt to split the item.
- Criterion 6 returns anything but `0` → a band vocabulary has been embedded here. That is a second source of truth for calibrated configuration. Blocker.
- Criterion 3 exits `0` instead of `3` → class inference has crept in. Blocker.

### TASK `L4-P5-13` — Material requirement change: re-plan event linked to estimate record

**Title:** Material requirement change — re-plan event linked to the estimate record it invalidates
**Phase:** 5
**Files touched:**
- `tools/records/replan.py`

**Deps:** L4-P5-04, L4-P3-01
**Acceptance command:** `python tools/records/replan.py --help`
**Spec anchor:** MasterSpec §29.5 lines 2699–2701

Documents `tools/records/replan.py`. When a requirement changes materially, execution is halted, the item carries the Blocked flag with reason `re-plan`, and a re-plan event is linked directly to the estimate record that is invalidated (§29.5).

**Commands**

```bash
python tools/records/replan.py --help
```

**Acceptance criteria**

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Replan tool help message accessible | `python tools/records/replan.py --help` | `usage: replan.py` |
| 2 | Replan tool script exists | `test -f tools/records/replan.py && echo present` | `present` |

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
python tools/records/replan.py --help
```

Expected output:
```
usage: replan.py [-h] [--selftest] [--input INPUT]
```

## 9. Tasks — subsystem I, ingest

Ids resume at `L4-P5-14`. `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` are the Ready-queue-miss detector, indexed as rows 70–78 of `L4-06-tasks.md` §2, and are not in this file.

**The standing rule for this half.** Every task writes a **declaration** plus a validator. None of them connects to a running system. Where evidence from a running system is needed, an **ASSISTED** task produces the request document and the evidence template, and the human lead returns the evidence file.

---

### TASK `L4-P5-14` — Ingest entry gate, `metrics/ingest/` skeleton and the `INGEST` dispatcher

**Mode** LANE · **Size** S · **Depends on** `L4-P5-03`, `L4-P3-06` · **Spec** §99.2 line 9196; §99.6 risk 2 line 9281
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/README.md`, `tools/records/validate-ingest.sh`, `tools/records/ingest/.gitkeep`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-14.sh`

This task proves entry conditions E1–E8 of §5 and stands up the dispatcher every later ingest task extends. It writes no collector declaration.

`metrics/ingest/README.md` names the downstream consumers so that no later reader assumes L4 renders anything. Subsystem H is unassigned (`D-L4-P5-03`); saying so in the file is the honest state, not a placeholder.

#### Commands

# metrics/ingest - collector declarations (Lane 4, subsystem I)

Master Spec section 99.2 line 9196 assigns to subsystem I:
"DevLake nightly ingest; Prometheus scraping /health, /version, /metrics;
Scorecard scheduled scan with drop detection; the event-log taxonomy;
attention ledger; metric source discipline".

## What lives here

One file per collector. Declarations only - what each collector is allowed to
source, at what cadence, under what confirmation state, and how a metric reading
from it must be armed. No file here installs, configures or contacts anything.

## Who consumes it, and who does not

| Consumer | What it takes | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operations VM install and collector configuration | cadence, targets, credentials shape | L5, ops-vm/** (subsystem M, spec line 9200) |
| Grafana surfaces of Section 92 | the armed set and the source kinds | subsystem H - UNASSIGNED in PARTITION v1, see D-L4-P5-03 |
| The metric register and the Section 103 computations | source-kinds.yaml, devlake-coverage.yaml | Lane 4 Phase 7, L4-P7-01 and L4-P7-02 |
| The reconciler drift rows | nothing in this directory | L3 |

L4 declares. L5 installs. H renders. Lane 4 opens no Grafana file and no
ops-vm/** file (PARTITION.md rule 1, line 25).

## The rule that binds every file here

Invariant 46 (spec line 9513): "Derived data is computed, never hand-maintained.
Metrics derive from the canonical record stores of Section 97, never from
hand-maintained numbers." DevLake, Prometheus and Scorecard are not Section 97
record stores. source-kinds.yaml (L4-P5-22) states what that means mechanically.

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-15` if:

- Any of E1–E8 fails. Each names the phase that owns it in §5. **Do not create another phase's artifact.** Blocker naming the condition id.
- Criterion 3 exits `0` instead of `3` → the dispatcher reports a missing limb as a pass. That is the fail-open shape §40.1 line 3671 forbids. Blocker.
- `metrics/ingest/` already exists on `integration` → a prior partial run. Blocker.

### TASK `L4-P5-15` — `collectors.yaml`: the three named collectors and their cadences

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-14` · **Spec** §99.2 line 9196; §94.2 lines 8406–8411; §84.4 line 8561; §85.2 line 8395
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/collectors.yaml`, `tools/records/ingest/collectors.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-15.sh`

§7.7 becomes one file. The collector set is **closed at three** because line 9196 names three. A fourth entry is a spec change, not a configuration change.

The Prometheus row deliberately declares **no scrape interval**. §38.4 line 3476 says a runaway becomes visible *"within a scrape interval"* and names no value; the interval belongs to the operations-VM Prometheus configuration, which is `ops-vm/**` and L5's (`PARTITION.md` line 21). Declaring a number here would invent one.

**Writes** `metrics/ingest/devlake.yaml`, `metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml`, `tools/records/ingest/devlake.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-16.sh`

This is the task the ingest half exists for. §99.3 item 4 (§7.9) says DevLake field coverage is **design-open** and must be *"confirm[ed] … before Phase G3"*. §30.3 line 2737 repeats it as an *"unverified capability assumption"*. §98 Phase G3 line 9133 lists *"DevLake field coverage confirmed"* as a dependency of that phase.

An unconfirmed assumption is only a caveat if something reads it. This task makes it mechanical: **`devlake-coverage.yaml` is the gate.** Every row is `unconfirmed` until a human returns evidence, and a consumer of an unconfirmed row renders `unarmed — not yet instrumented` under D77 (§52.2 line 4524) — never as a miss, never as zero.

**The consumer census is thirteen, and it is not a judgment call.** A DevLake consumer is a metric or signal row whose Source cell names DevLake. Those rows are at spec lines 4533, 4536, 4537, 4569, 7048, 7052, 7053, 9782, 9787, 9794, 9811, 9954 and 9963. Criterion 3 below proves each of those lines really does contain the string `DevLake`, so no line number in the file is inferred.

**The three bespoke computations are the three named in item 4, verbatim** — *"routine reviews absorbed cross-checked against the routing table, reviewer familiarity, reviewer-spread measures"*. They carry `covered_by_devlake_models: false` because line 9243 says they *"require bespoke computation beyond DevLake's models"*. That is a transcription, not an assessment.

**You do not confirm coverage in this task.** Confirmation needs the DevLake console; that is `L4-P5-17`, and it is ASSISTED.

#### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous expected output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The limb passes with the frozen counters | `bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --devlake` | `INGEST OK devlake consumers=13 bespoke=3 coverage_rows=16 gate=G3` |
| 2 | Thirteen consumers, three bespoke, sixteen coverage rows | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;d=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/devlake.yaml'));c=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml'));print(len(d['consumers']),len(d['bespoke_computations']),len(c['rows']))"` | `13 3 16` |
| 3 | **No line number is inferred** — every cited spec line really contains `DevLake` | `for n in 4533 4536 4537 4569 7048 7052 7053 9782 9787 9794 9811 9954 9963 9243; do sed -n "${n}p" "$SPEC" \| grep -q DevLake \|\| echo "BAD $n"; done; echo SPECLINES-OK` | `SPECLINES-OK`, with no `BAD` line before it |
| 4 | Every coverage row is `unconfirmed` | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;r=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml'))['rows'];print(sorted({x['state'] for x in r}))"` | `['unconfirmed']` |
| 5 | The gate is G3 and the coverage flag is false | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;c=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml'));print(c['gate_phase'],c['confirmed'])"` | `G3 False` |
| 6 | L4 declares **no** database engine | `grep -ci "postgres\|mysql\|mariadb\|sqlite\|clickhouse" metrics/ingest/devlake.yaml` | `0` |
| 7 | The unconfirmed arming string is the frozen §7.10 string, em dash included — checked by code point so no em dash need be typed | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;s=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml'))['arming_state_while_unconfirmed'];print(len(s),ord(s[8])==8212,s.endswith('not yet instrumented'))"` | `30 True True` |
| 8 | The check **can fail** — a row confirmed with no evidence is rejected | `cp metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml /tmp/dc.bak && "$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;p='metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml';d=yaml.safe_load(open(p));d['rows'][0]['state']='confirmed';yaml.safe_dump(d,open(p,'w'))" && bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --devlake; echo "exit=$?"; cp /tmp/dc.bak metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml` | `INGEST FAIL devlake confirmed-without-evidence:C01` then `exit=1` |
| 9 | The check **fails closed** when its input is gone | `mv metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml /tmp/dc2.bak; bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --devlake; echo "exit=$?"; mv /tmp/dc2.bak metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml` | `INGEST ERROR devlake-unreadable:devlake-coverage.yaml:FileNotFoundError` then `exit=3` |
| 10 | Nothing outside the owned paths | `bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths` | `PATHS OK` |

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR" && bash tools/records/check.sh L4-P5-16; echo "exit=$?"
```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

```
CHECK L4-P5-16 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-17` if:

- Criterion 3 prints any `BAD <n>` line → a spec line number in this file does not name DevLake. **Do not "fix" it by editing the number.** Blocker, quoting the `BAD` line.
- Criterion 8 exits `0` → the gate accepts a confirmation with no evidence, and the §99.3 caveat is decoration (`L4-06-tasks.md` §0.8 rule 9). Blocker.
- Criterion 9 exits `0` or `1` instead of `3` → the limb reports a pass it cannot support (§40.1 line 3671). Blocker.
- Any step appears to require opening DevLake, running a connector, or reading a token. That is `L4-P5-17` and it is **ASSISTED**. Blocker.
- You are tempted to set a row to `confirmed` because it "obviously" works. **Never.** Blocker.

#### Close the task

```bash
set -euo pipefail

### TASK `L4-P5-17` — **ASSISTED** — DevLake connector field-coverage confirmation

**Mode ASSISTED** · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-16` · **Spec** §99.3 item 4 line 9243; §30.3 line 2737; §98 Phase G3 line 9133
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/requests/L4-P5-17-devlake-coverage-request.md`, `metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-17.sh`
**Does NOT write** `metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.yaml` — that file is authored by the human lead and by nobody else.

> **ASSISTED — read this before typing anything.** Confirming connector field coverage requires the DevLake console or API on the operations VM and the connector's configured GitHub token (§3.1; §30.3 line 2737). You must not hold either. **You produce the request document and the evidence template, open the handoff issue, and stop.** You do not open DevLake. You do not run a connector. You do not paste a credential anywhere, including into a blocker issue. If you find yourself about to, that is the STOP rule firing.

The evidence rule of §3.1 applies in full: **a validator that passes on an evidence file you wrote is not a check.** `L4-P5-16`'s limb already refuses an evidence file whose `authored_by` is `lane-4` or empty. This task keeps that true by shipping a template in which every answer field is `PENDING-HUMAN`.

# ASSISTED request L4-P5-17 - DevLake connector field coverage

Requested of: the L0 human lead, or a delegate holding operations-VM access.
Requested by: Lane 4, Phase 5, task L4-P5-17. Prepared by the lane executor, who holds
no DevLake credential and ran nothing against DevLake.

## Why this request exists

Master Spec section 99.3 item 4, line 9243, verbatim:

  "DevLake field coverage - several metrics (routine reviews absorbed cross-checked
   against the routing table, reviewer familiarity, reviewer-spread measures) require
   bespoke computation beyond DevLake's models; confirm coverage before Phase G3."

Section 30.3 line 2737 lists "DevLake's connector field coverage and required database
engine" among the unverified capability assumptions, "each confirmed before the phase
depending on it". Section 98 Phase G3, line 9133, lists "DevLake field coverage
confirmed" as a dependency of Phase G3.

Until this request is answered, all sixteen rows of metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml
stay "unconfirmed" and every consumer renders "unarmed - not yet instrumented"
(D77, section 52.2 line 4524). Nothing breaks. Nothing lies either.

## What is being asked

For each of the sixteen rows below, answer exactly one of:

  confirmed   - DevLake, as configured on this estate, supplies what this row needs
  unavailable - it does not, and a bespoke computation or another source is required

Do not answer "partial". A row that is partly covered is "unavailable" for this gate:
the gate exists to stop a metric arming on data that is not fully there.

## The sixteen rows

Thirteen consumers - every spec row whose Source cell names DevLake:

| ref | consumer | spec line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | SIG-04 Review concentration | 4533 |
| C02 | SIG-07 Team Lead bottleneck | 4536 |
| C03 | SIG-08 QA bottleneck | 4537 |
| C04 | SIG-40 Cross-review participation | 4569 |
| C05 | Review distribution spread | 7048 |
| C06 | Verification demand vs capacity | 7052 |
| C07 | Gate 1 latency | 7053 |
| C08 | PR cycle time per product | 9782 |
| C09 | Cross-review turnaround | 9787 |
| C10 | Lead time, merge to production | 9794 |
| C11 | Undeclared weekend activations per quarter | 9811 |
| C12 | Review hours per product per month | 9954 |
| C13 | Ownership transfer time to first verified change | 9963 |

Three bespoke computations - quoted from line 9243:

| ref | quoted | spec line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | routine reviews absorbed cross-checked against the routing table | 9243 |
| B2 | reviewer familiarity | 9243 |
| B3 | reviewer-spread measures | 9243 |

## How to answer

Copy metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml to
metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.yaml, fill every PENDING-HUMAN field,
and commit it. Then set the matching rows in metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml to the
answered state with confirmed_by and confirmed_at populated, and set the top-level
"confirmed" flag to true only when every row is answered. The validator
(tools/records/ingest/devlake.py) refuses any other combination.

## What the lane executor did NOT do

- did not open the DevLake console or call its API
- did not read, hold or transcribe any credential
- did not author metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.yaml
- did not set any row of devlake-coverage.yaml to anything but "unconfirmed"

## Also unanswered, and deliberately not asked here

The required database engine (section 30.3 line 2737) is an operations-VM concern:
PARTITION.md line 21 gives ops-vm/** to L5. It is not part of this request.

#### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous expected output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The request document exists | `test -f metrics/ingest/requests/L4-P5-17-devlake-coverage-request.md && echo OK` | `OK` |
| 2 | The template is a template, not an answer — 21 lines still awaiting a human | `grep -c "PENDING-HUMAN" metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml` | `21` |
| 3 | The lane confirmed nothing (`grep -c` exiting `1` on no match is normal; the printed `0` is the criterion) | `grep -c "state: confirmed" metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml` | `0` |
| 4 | The real evidence file was **not** created by the lane | `test -f metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.yaml && echo CREATED \|\| echo NOT-CREATED` | `NOT-CREATED` |
| 5 | Coverage rows are still all unconfirmed | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;r=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/devlake-coverage.yaml'))['rows'];print(sorted({x['state'] for x in r}))"` | `['unconfirmed']` |
| 6 | The template carries no credential field | `grep -ci "token\|password\|secret\|api_key\|connection_string" metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml` | `0` |
| 7 | The DevLake limb still passes | `bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --devlake` | `INGEST OK devlake consumers=13 bespoke=3 coverage_rows=16 gate=G3` |
| 8 | The handoff issue is open | `gh issue list --repo "${CP_SLUG}" --label assisted --search "L4-P5-17" --json number \| grep -c number` | `1` |
| 9 | Nothing outside the owned paths | `bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths` | `PATHS OK` |

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR" && bash tools/records/check.sh L4-P5-17; echo "exit=$?"
```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

```
CHECK L4-P5-17 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-18` if:

- Any step would have you open the DevLake console, call its API, or read a credential. **That is the ASSISTED boundary of §3.** Blocker.
- Criterion 4 prints `CREATED` → the lane authored the evidence file. Delete it, commit nothing, and file the blocker.
- Criterion 2 prints anything other than `21` → the template has been partly filled. A partly-filled template is an answer, and the lane does not answer. Blocker.
- `gh issue create` fails → the handoff never reached a human, so the task is not done even though its files exist. Blocker.

**Once the handoff issue is open, this task is complete for you.** Do not wait for the answer; the coverage gate blocks Phase G3, not this phase. Take `L4-P5-18`.

#### Close the task

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR"
bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths
git add metrics/ingest/requests/L4-P5-17-devlake-coverage-request.md metrics/ingest/evidence/devlake-coverage-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml tools/records/checks/L4-P5-17.sh

### TASK `L4-P5-18` — Prometheus scrape declaration: the three §41.2 endpoints

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-15` · **Spec** §41.2 lines 3719, 3723–3725, 3726, 3728; §38.4 line 3476; §19.2 line 1892; §103.2 line 9798
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/prometheus.yaml`, `tools/records/ingest/prometheus.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-18.sh`

§7.8 becomes one file. Five things about this task are easy to get wrong, so they are stated before the commands:

1. **Three endpoints, not four, and the `Provides` strings are transcribed character-for-character** from spec lines 3723–3725. They are *"the entire runtime interface the operating system requires of a served product"* (line 3719).
2. **The endpoints are not a public surface** (line 3726). The estate's declared posture is `private-authenticated`, with a **per-product scrape credential**, and `public` is *"a recorded Founder decision, never a default inherited from a framework."* A file that declares `public` here is wrong, not configurable.
3. **The private path is a scrape path only** — line 3726: *"it carries the operations VM no production credential, no deploy key and no environment access."* The declaration says so explicitly, so a later reader cannot quietly widen it.
4. **No interval, no host, no port, no URL.** The Prometheus configuration lives on the operations VM, which is `ops-vm/**` and L5's (`PARTITION.md` line 21). Criterion 6 fails the task if a URL or a port appears anywhere in the file.
5. **Export the `/version` digest observation to a named records-repo path per REG-034.**

A product declaring a profile that cannot serve an endpoint *"meets the equivalent evidence of Section 15.7 instead, and is never failed for lacking an endpoint its shape cannot serve"* (line 3719). That exemption is declared here, not inferred later.

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-19` if:

- Criterion 3 prints anything but `ALL-VERBATIM` → a `provides` string was paraphrased. Retype it from §7.8; do not adjust the criterion. Blocker if it still fails.
- Any step asks you for a scrape interval, a hostname, a port, a URL or an alert rule → every one of those is `ops-vm/**` and L5's. Blocker.
- Criterion 8 exits `0` → the file would accept `public` silently, which line 3726 forbids. Blocker.
- A product name or a product count is needed anywhere in this task. It is not: this file is estate-wide and per-product facts belong to the ASSISTED evidence of `L4-P5-19`. Blocker if you think otherwise.

### TASK `L4-P5-19` — **ASSISTED** — private-path scrape reachability evidence

**Mode ASSISTED** · **Size** S · **Depends on** `L4-P5-18` · **Spec** §41.2 line 3726; §19.2 line 1892
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/requests/L4-P5-19-scrape-reachability-request.md`, `metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-19.sh`
**Does NOT write** `metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.yaml`.

> **ASSISTED — read this before typing anything.** §19.2 line 1892 makes launch readiness require *"`/metrics` verified unreachable from the public internet unless a recorded Founder decision declares it `public`"*. Verifying that needs a session on the operations VM and the per-product scrape credential (§41.2 line 3726). You must not hold either. **You produce the request document and the evidence template, open the handoff issue, and stop.** You do not `curl` a product endpoint — not from the private path, and above all not from the public internet.

The template records a **host role**, never a hostname or an address, and carries `credentials_present: false` for the same reason `L4-P5-18` forbids a URL in its declaration.

# ASSISTED request L4-P5-19 - private-path scrape reachability

Requested of: the L0 human lead, or a delegate holding operations-VM access and the
per-product scrape credential.
Requested by: Lane 4, Phase 5, task L4-P5-19. Prepared by the lane executor, who holds
no scrape credential and issued no request to any product endpoint.

## Why this request exists

Master Spec section 41.2 line 3726: "The three endpoints are not a public surface. ...
the estate's declared posture is private-authenticated: the endpoints are reachable only
over the private path from the operations VM, with a per-product scrape credential ...
public remains available and is a recorded Founder decision, never a default inherited
from a framework."

Section 19.2 line 1892 makes it a launch-readiness row: "observability.telemetry_exposure
declared, and /metrics verified unreachable from the public internet unless a recorded
Founder decision declares it public (Section 41.2)."

metrics/ingest/prometheus.yaml declares the posture. It cannot prove it. This request is
the proof, and only a human with operations-VM access can produce it.

## What is being asked, per product

For every product whose declared conformance_profile is "service" or "white-label"
(spec line 3719) - and for no other product, because line 3719 says a product with a
different shape "is never failed for lacking an endpoint its shape cannot serve":

1. GET /health answers over the private path from the operations VM, with the
   per-product scrape credential
2. GET /version answers over the private path, same conditions
3. GET /metrics answers over the private path, same conditions
4. GET /metrics is NOT reachable from the public internet - unless a recorded Founder
   decision declares this product's telemetry_exposure "public", in which case name the
   decision record instead of asserting unreachability
5. observability.telemetry_exposure is declared for the product (line 1892)

Answer each with: yes | no | founder-decision-public

## How to answer

Copy metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml to
metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.yaml, duplicate the product block
once per in-scope product, and fill every PENDING-HUMAN field. Commit it.

## What must NOT go in the evidence file

No hostname, no IP address, no URL, no port, no credential, no token. Record the host
ROLE ("operations VM") and the outcome. The private path "carries the operations VM no
production credential, no deploy key and no environment access" (line 3726), and the
evidence of that path must not become the place those things get written down.

## What the lane executor did NOT do

- did not issue any request to any product endpoint, private or public
- did not hold or transcribe a scrape credential
- did not author metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.yaml

#### Acceptance criteria

|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The request document exists | `test -f metrics/ingest/requests/L4-P5-19-scrape-reachability-request.md && echo OK` | `OK` |
| 2 | The template is unfilled — ten fields awaiting a human | `grep -c "PENDING-HUMAN" metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml` | `10` |
| 3 | No address, URL or host in the template | `grep -ci "http\|[0-9][0-9]*\.[0-9][0-9]*\.[0-9][0-9]*\.[0-9][0-9]*" metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml` | `0` |
| 4 | The real evidence file was **not** created by the lane | `test -f metrics/ingest/evidence/scrape-reachability-evidence.yaml && echo CREATED \|\| echo NOT-CREATED` | `NOT-CREATED` |

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash
set -euo pipefail

```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

```
CHECK L4-P5-19 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-20` if:

- Any step would have you `curl`, `wget` or otherwise request a product endpoint. **Probing a product endpoint from the public internet is never a lane action.** Blocker.
- You are asked for the product list, a hostname or a scrape credential. None of those belongs in this task. Blocker.
- Criterion 4 prints `CREATED`. Delete the file, commit nothing, file the blocker.
- `gh issue create` fails. Blocker — the handoff did not reach a human.

**Once the handoff issue is open, this task is complete for you.** Take `L4-P5-20`.

#### Close the task

### TASK `L4-P5-20` — Scorecard scheduled scan and drop detection

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-15` · **Spec** §99.2 line 9196; §94.2 line 8406; §84.4 line 8561; §85.2 line 8395; §92.3 line 8300; §94.6 line 8537; §15.1; §19.2 line 1896; §17.3 line 1771; §30.3 line 2737
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml`, `tools/records/ingest/scorecard.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-20.sh`

Line 9196 asks for *"Scorecard scheduled scan **with drop detection**"*. The scan half is fully specified — nightly, 02:00 (§94.2 line 8406; §84.4 line 8561), producing *"Risk score per product"* (§85.2 line 8395). **The drop half is not**, and this task does not invent it:

- §92.3 line 8300 states the **routing**: *"A Scorecard score drop never sends the Founder to browse raw scores: it arrives either as a decision prompt (where a Founder decision is genuinely required) or as an owned line on the Reliability dimension, naming the product, the drop and the owner already acting on it."* §94.6 line 8537 places it in the Monday 09:45 slot on the same terms. Both are transcribed.
- The **magnitude** of a drop: D-L4-P5-02 decided `any_decrease` (any strictly negative delta). Two conditions are declared, `decrease` and `below_minimum`, and the routing threshold is `any_decrease`.
- The **record store** a Scorecard result lands in is nowhere stated — see **DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P5-01**. `source_store` is written as `PENDING-D-L4-P5-01`.

`security.scorecard_minimum` is a **product-contract field** (§15.1, initial value `7.0`) owned by L1. This file names the key and never a value. And because Scorecard behaviour against private repositories is an unverified capability assumption (§30.3 line 2737, confirmed in `L4-P5-21`), the whole collector ships `unarmed — not yet instrumented`.

### TASK `L4-P5-21` — **ASSISTED** — Scorecard private-repository behaviour and baseline scan

**Mode ASSISTED** · **Size** S · **Depends on** `L4-P5-20` · **Spec** §30.3 line 2737; §98 Phase 2 line 9029; §98 completion check line 9035
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/requests/L4-P5-21-scorecard-behaviour-request.md`, `metrics/ingest/evidence/scorecard-behaviour-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-21.sh`
**Does NOT write** `metrics/ingest/evidence/scorecard-behaviour-evidence.yaml`.

> **ASSISTED — read this before typing anything.** §30.3 line 2737 lists *"Scorecard behaviour against private repositories"* as an unverified capability assumption. Confirming it, and running the Phase 2 baseline scan across all products (§98 line 9029), needs a GitHub organisation-owner session. You must not hold one. **You produce the request document and the evidence template, open the handoff issue, and stop.**

Until the evidence returns, `metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml` keeps `private_repo_behaviour_confirmed: false` and the collector stays `unarmed — not yet instrumented`. The completion check of §98 Phase 2 (line 9035) — *"every product visible in Grafana with a Scorecard score"* — is not this lane's to close: Grafana is subsystem H, unassigned (**D-L4-P5-03**).

# ASSISTED request L4-P5-21 - Scorecard behaviour against private repositories

Requested of: the L0 human lead, or a delegate holding a GitHub organisation-owner session.
Requested by: Lane 4, Phase 5, task L4-P5-21. Prepared by the lane executor, who holds no
organisation-owner session and ran no scan.

## Why this request exists

Master Spec section 30.3 line 2737 lists, among the unverified capability assumptions
"each confirmed before the phase depending on it": "Scorecard behaviour against private
repositories".

Section 98 Phase 2, line 9029: "Scorecard baseline scan across all products".

Every repository in this estate is private. If Scorecard does not produce a usable score
against a private repository, then the launch-readiness row at section 19.2 line 1896
("Scorecard at or above the declared minimum; no unresolved high findings"), the risk
score of section 85.2 line 8395, and the drop detection of section 92.3 line 8300 all
have no source - and metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml must stay unarmed rather than render
a zero that reads like a healthy score.

## What is being asked

1. Does Scorecard run against a private repository in this organisation, and does it
   return a score? yes | no | partial-with-note
2. Which checks, if any, are unavailable or degraded against a private repository?
3. Was the Phase 2 baseline scan run across all products (spec line 9029)?
4. On what date, and against how many products? (count only - no product list is needed
   in this file)
5. If the answer to 1 is no or partial: what is the recorded fallback, and is it an
   accepted risk with a named holder and a review date?

## How to answer

Copy metrics/ingest/evidence/scorecard-behaviour-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml to
metrics/ingest/evidence/scorecard-behaviour-evidence.yaml, fill every PENDING-HUMAN
field, and commit it. Then, and only then, set private_repo_behaviour_confirmed in
metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml and move arming_state off "unarmed - not yet instrumented".

## What the lane executor did NOT do

- did not open a GitHub organisation-owner session
- did not run a Scorecard scan against any repository
- did not author metrics/ingest/evidence/scorecard-behaviour-evidence.yaml
- did not change private_repo_behaviour_confirmed or arming_state

## Not asked here, deliberately

"Every product visible in Grafana with a Scorecard score" (the Phase 2 completion check,
line 9035) is a subsystem H surface. Subsystem H is unassigned in PARTITION v1
(D-L4-P5-03). Lane 4 opens no Grafana file.

#### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous expected output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The request document exists | `test -f metrics/ingest/requests/L4-P5-21-scorecard-behaviour-request.md && echo OK` | `OK` |
| 2 | The template is unfilled — ten fields awaiting a human | `grep -c "PENDING-HUMAN" metrics/ingest/evidence/scorecard-behaviour-evidence.TEMPLATE.yaml` | `10` |
| 3 | The real evidence file was **not** created by the lane | `test -f metrics/ingest/evidence/scorecard-behaviour-evidence.yaml && echo CREATED \|\| echo NOT-CREATED` | `NOT-CREATED` |
| 4 | The collector is still unconfirmed and unarmed | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;d=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml'));print(d['private_repo_behaviour_confirmed'],d['arming_state'].startswith('unarmed'))"` | `False True` |
| 5 | The Scorecard limb still passes | `bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --scorecard` | `INGEST OK scorecard conditions=2 pending=2 arming=unarmed` |
| 6 | No Grafana file was touched (subsystem H is unassigned) | `git diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD \| grep -ci "grafana\|dashboard"` | `0` |
| 7 | The handoff issue is open | `gh issue list --repo "${CP_SLUG}" --label assisted --search "L4-P5-21" --json number \| grep -c number` | `1` |

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR" && bash tools/records/check.sh L4-P5-21; echo "exit=$?"
```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

```
CHECK L4-P5-21 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-22` if:

- Any step would have you open a GitHub organisation-owner session or run a Scorecard scan. Blocker.
- Any step would have you set `private_repo_behaviour_confirmed` to `true`, or move `arming_state` off the unarmed string. **Only the returned evidence moves it, and only a human writes that evidence.** Blocker.
- Criterion 6 prints anything but `0` → a Grafana or dashboard file was touched. Subsystem H is unassigned (**D-L4-P5-03**) and is not yours. Revert it. Blocker.
- `gh issue create` fails. Blocker.

**Once the handoff issue is open, this task is complete for you.** Take `L4-P5-22`.

### TASK `L4-P5-22` — Metric source discipline: the `source_kind` rule and its validator

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-16`, `L4-P5-18`, `L4-P5-20` · **Spec** §101.7 invariant 46 line 9513; §103 preamble line 9776; §52.2 line 4522; §1 line 395; §97.2 table lines 8845–8869
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/source-kinds.yaml`, `tools/records/ingest/source_kind.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-22.sh`

This is the last clause of the §99.2 subsystem I row — *"metric source discipline"* — and it is the one that keeps the other three honest.

Invariant 46, line 9513, verbatim: *"Derived data is computed, never hand-maintained. Metrics derive from the canonical record stores of Section 97 (Records, Events and Data Conventions), never from hand-maintained numbers."* The §103 preamble, line 9776, restates it; §52.2 line 4522 says of the signal table *"values are derived, never hand-maintained"*; line 395 says *"Derived metrics are never edited by hand."*

**The tension, and its mechanical resolution.** DevLake, Prometheus and Scorecard are collectors. None is a §97.2 canonical record store — that table (lines 8845–8869) lists none of them. Yet §103.1 and §103.2 name DevLake under a column headed *"Source (record store)"* at lines 9782, 9787 and 9794. Rather than argue with the spec, this file **types every source**: `record_store` is the only kind that may be a source of truth; `collector` never is; and any measure whose only source is a collector is declared as such, in writing, where the register of Phase 7 will read it.

The second half is the anti-hand-maintenance rule made checkable: **no file under `metrics/ingest/**` may carry a metric value.** A declaration file with a `count:` or a `score:` in it has become a hand-maintained number, which is exactly what invariant 46 forbids. The validator walks every YAML file in the tree, at every depth, and fails on the forbidden key set.

- Criterion 7 exits `0` → the anti-hand-maintenance rule is decoration. Blocker.

### TASK `L4-P5-23` — Ingest freshness and the three arming strings

**Mode** LANE · **Size** M · **Depends on** `L4-P5-22` · **Spec** §51.2 line 4459; §52.2 line 4524; §101.7 invariant 47 line 9514
**Writes** `metrics/ingest/freshness.yaml`, `tools/records/ingest/freshness.py`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-23.sh`

Two jobs, and the second is the most valuable check in the phase.

**One.** §51.2 line 4459 states the only collector freshness SLO in the specification: *"DevLake ingest freshness | Ingest completes at least daily | Age of the newest ingested row | Amber; the signals sourced from DevLake render as armed — source stale (Section 52.2) rather than as within tolerance."* That row is transcribed. **Prometheus and Scorecard have no stated freshness SLO**, so this file declares `none-declared-in-spec` for both and L4 invents neither a bound nor a rendering for them. Inventing one would be designing, which §4 forbids.

**Two.** The frozen arming vocabulary of §7.10 is enforced across the whole tree. Only three strings may appear as an arming value anywhere under `metrics/ingest/**`. A fourth string — however sensible it reads — is a new vocabulary, and a new vocabulary is how an instrument quietly starts saying something the specification never authorised. The validator sweeps every YAML file, at every depth, and fails on any string beginning `armed` or `unarmed` that is not one of the three.

**Retention is not declared here.** Invariant 47 (line 9514) says raw activity telemetry retention classes *"are declared in the control plane and owned by the Founder"*, and the class file is `metrics/retention/retention-classes.yaml`, built by `L4-P3-07` (entry condition E8). This task asserts that file is reachable and declares **no** class of its own.

#### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous expected output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The limb passes with the frozen counters | `bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --freshness` | `INGEST OK freshness slo=1 none-declared=2 arming_strings=3 violations=0` |
| 2 | The DevLake SLO row is the spec's, word for word | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;d=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/freshness.yaml'))['collectors']['devlake'];print(d['freshness_slo'],'/',d['measured_by'],'/',d['breach_class'])"` | `Ingest completes at least daily / Age of the newest ingested row / Amber` |
| 3 | That row really is at line 4459 | `sed -n '4459p' "$SPEC" \| grep -c "DevLake ingest freshness"` | `1` |
| 4 | Two collectors carry no invented SLO | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;c=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/freshness.yaml'))['collectors'];print(c['prometheus']['freshness_slo'],c['scorecard']['freshness_slo'])"` | `none-declared-in-spec none-declared-in-spec` |
| 5 | The arming vocabulary is exactly three, and closed | `"$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;d=yaml.safe_load(open('metrics/ingest/freshness.yaml'));print(len(d['arming_vocabulary']),d['closed_vocabulary'])"` | `3 True` |
| 6 | No retention class is declared here | `grep -c "^retention_class_declared_here: false" metrics/ingest/freshness.yaml` | `1` |
| 7 | The check **can fail** — a fourth arming string anywhere is rejected | `cp metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml /tmp/fr.bak && "$L4_PY" -c "import yaml;p='metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml';d=yaml.safe_load(open(p));d['arming_state']='armed - probably fine';yaml.safe_dump(d,open(p,'w'))" && bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --freshness; echo "exit=$?"; cp /tmp/fr.bak metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml` | `INGEST FAIL freshness arming-string-outside-frozen-vocabulary:scorecard.yaml:armed - probably fine` then `exit=1` |
| 8 | The check **fails closed** when the retention file is unreachable | `mv metrics/retention/retention-classes.yaml /tmp/rc.bak; bash tools/records/validate-ingest.sh --freshness; echo "exit=$?"; mv /tmp/rc.bak metrics/retention/retention-classes.yaml` | `INGEST ERROR retention-classes-unreachable` then `exit=3` |

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash
set -euo pipefail

```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

```
CHECK L4-P5-23 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not proceed to `L4-P5-24` if:

- Any step would have you write a freshness bound for Prometheus or Scorecard. **The specification states none, and this file states that it states none.** Blocker.
- Any step would have you add a fourth arming string, or reword one of the three. The three are transcribed at §7.10. Blocker.
- Criterion 7 exits `0` → a fourth vocabulary passes and the arming discipline is decoration. Blocker.
- Criterion 8 exits `0` or `1` instead of `3` → the limb passes without its cross-file input. Blocker.
- `metrics/retention/retention-classes.yaml` is missing on `integration` → entry condition E8 has not merged. **Do not create it**; it is `L4-P3-07`'s. Blocker naming E8.

### TASK `L4-P5-24` — Phase sweep, rebase, PR

**Mode** LANE · **Size** S · **Depends on** `L4-P5-01`…`L4-P5-04`, `L4-P5-14`…`L4-P5-23` · **Spec** — none new; this task adds no declaration
**Writes** `tools/records/sweep-phase5.sh`, `tools/records/checks/L4-P5-24.sh`

The sweep runs both dispatchers and every task check this file owns, in one command, and prints one line. It adds no new rule: a sweep that can invent a pass is worse than no sweep.

**This is not the P5 exit gate.** `L4-06-tasks.md` §5 defines gate P5 as `bash tools/records/validate-boards.sh && bash tools/records/test-rqm-detector.sh` with the final line `RQM OK 6/6`. The Ready-queue-miss detector (`L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13`) is not in this file, so **this sweep cannot close the phase.** It proves the ingest-and-boards half is whole; gate P5 stays owned by `L4-06-tasks.md`, and it passes only when the detector lands too.

#### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous expected output |
|---|---|---|---|

| 8 | No foreign path was touched by any Phase 5 branch merged so far | `git diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD \| grep -vc "^metrics/\|^tools/records/"` | `0` |

#### SELF-VERIFY

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR" && bash tools/records/check.sh L4-P5-24; echo "exit=$?"
```

**Expected output — exactly these two lines:**

```
CHECK L4-P5-24 PASS
exit=0
```

#### STOP RULE

Do not close the phase if:

- Criterion 1 prints `checks=` anything but `14`, or `pending=` anything but `4` → a task did not land, or a placeholder was answered inside the lane. Blocker.
- Criterion 4 prints anything but `4` → an L0 decision was answered by an executor. **Revert it.** Blocker.
- Criterion 5 exits `0` or `1` instead of `3`. Blocker.
- You are about to run `test-rqm-detector.sh` and it does not exist. It is not this file's; the detector is `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` in `L4-06-tasks.md`. **Do not create it here.** This is not a blocker — it is the expected state; simply stop, and report that gate P5 remains open pending the detector.

#### Close the task

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cd "$CP_DIR"
bash tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh --paths
git add tools/records/sweep-phase5.sh tools/records/checks/L4-P5-24.sh
git commit -m "L4-P5-24: phase 5 sweep for the ingest and boards tasks"

## 10. Phase sweep, and what it does and does not close

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| What closes the tasks in **this file**? | `bash tools/records/sweep-phase5.sh` → `PHASE5 OK boards=1 ingest=6 checks=14 pending=2` (`L4-P5-24`) |
| What closes **Phase 5**? | Gate P5 of `L4-06-tasks.md` §5: `bash tools/records/validate-boards.sh && bash tools/records/test-rqm-detector.sh` → `RQM OK 6/6`. It needs `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13`, which are not in this file. |
| Can this file's sweep substitute for gate P5? | **No.** A sweep that closed a gate it does not cover would be exactly the vacuous-instrument failure of §99.6 risk 2 (line 9281). |
| What must be true before Phase 6 starts? | Gate P5, not this sweep. `L4-P6-09` depends on `L4-P5-02` (`L4-06-tasks.md` row 87), which this file delivers. |

The two frozen dispatcher names of §0.3 are what the sweep greps: `BOARDS` for `validate-boards.sh`, `INGEST` for `validate-ingest.sh`. Renaming either breaks `sweep-phase5.sh` silently, which is why §0.3 froze them.

---

## 11. Placeholder inventory — everything this phase ships unanswered

Four placeholder tokens leave this phase in the tree, plus one behavioural rule. **Every one is an L0 decision from §6.** No executor answers any of them; `L4-P5-24` criterion 4 fails the sweep if one is answered inside the lane.

| Token | File | Decision | What ships until it is answered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PENDING-D-L4-P5-01` | `metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml` (`source_store`), `metrics/ingest/source-kinds.yaml` (`backing_record_store`) | D-L4-P5-01 | Scorecard is typed `collector` with no backing store; the drop measure cannot render as a miss |
| ~~`PENDING-D-L4-P5-02`~~ | `metrics/ingest/scorecard.yaml` (`routing_threshold`) | D-L4-P5-02 **decided** | Decided: `routing_threshold: any_decrease`. Token removed from sweep. |
| `UNASSIGNED-D-L4-P5-03` | `metrics/ingest/collectors.yaml` (`rendering_subsystem_lane`), `metrics/ingest/README.md`, `metrics/ingest/source-kinds.yaml` | D-L4-P5-03 | Subsystem H is named as the renderer and as unassigned. L4 opens no Grafana file. |
| ~~`PENDING-D-L4-P5-04`~~ | `metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml` (`selected_mode`) | D-L4-P5-04 **decided** | Decided: `selected_mode: single_project_fallback`. Token removed from sweep. |
| *(no token — a required argument)* | `tools/records/estimate_capture.py` (`--item-class`) | D-L4-P5-05 | The caller supplies the item class; the module **never infers** it, and a call without it exits `3` |

Three further open items are **not** placeholders in the tree, because they are ASSISTED evidence rather than decisions:

| Awaiting | Task | Held open by |
|---|---|---|
| DevLake connector field coverage — sixteen rows | `L4-P5-17` | §99.3 item 4 line 9243; blocks Phase G3 (line 9133), nothing here |
| Private-path scrape reachability per product | `L4-P5-19` | §19.2 line 1892; blocks the launch-readiness row, nothing here |
| Scorecard behaviour against private repositories | `L4-P5-21` | §30.3 line 2737; holds the Scorecard collector unarmed, nothing here |

---

## 12. Traceability — every clause of the two §99.2 rows to a task

Subsystem **I**, line 9196, clause by clause:

| Clause, verbatim | Task | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| *"DevLake nightly ingest"* | `L4-P5-15`, `L4-P5-16`, `L4-P5-17` | `collectors.yaml`, `devlake.yaml`, `devlake-coverage.yaml`, the ASSISTED request |
| *"Prometheus scraping `/health`, `/version`, `/metrics`"* | `L4-P5-18`, `L4-P5-19` | `prometheus.yaml`, the reachability request |
| *"Scorecard scheduled scan with drop detection"* | `L4-P5-20`, `L4-P5-21` | `scorecard.yaml`, the behaviour request |
| *"the event-log taxonomy"* | **not this file** — `L4-P3-01` | `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml` (entry condition E5) |
| *"attention ledger"* | **not this file** — Phase 6, `L4-P6-01`…`L4-P6-09` | `metrics/attention/**` |
| *"metric source discipline"* | `L4-P5-22`, `L4-P5-23` | `source-kinds.yaml`, `freshness.yaml` |

Subsystem **N**, line 9201, clause by clause:

| Clause, verbatim | Task | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| *"Boards per product plus portfolio aggregate (or the single-Project fallback)"* | `L4-P5-01` | `metrics/boards/board-conventions.yaml` — both modes, §29.1 lines 2633–2635 |
| *"horizon semantics"* | `L4-P5-02` | `metrics/boards/horizons.yaml` — H1/H2/H3 and `unplanned`, §29.2 |
| *"Ready-to-Execute definition"* | `L4-P5-03` | `metrics/boards/ready-definition.yaml` — all ten criteria, §29.3 |
| *"automatic Ready-queue-miss recording"* | **not this file** — `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` | `tools/records/rqm/**`, indexed as rows 70–78 of `L4-06-tasks.md` §2 |
| D79 banded estimate at Ready confirmation (§29.3 line 2665) | `L4-P5-04` | `tools/records/estimate_capture.py` |

---

## 13. Routed out of this file — state the dependency, never claim the path

| Need | Owner | Why this file does not do it |
|---|---|---|
| Any Grafana or dashboard surface that renders these declarations | **Subsystem H — no lane in `PARTITION.md` v1** | Escalated as **D-L4-P5-03**. The known partition gap covers G, H, J, O and P; it is not re-litigated here. L4 opens no Grafana file. |
| Installing DevLake, Prometheus, Grafana or Scorecard; the compose file; the database engine; the scrape interval; the alert rule; hostnames and ports | L5 (`ops-vm/**`) | `PARTITION.md` line 21. Every declaration in this phase names `installed_by_lane: L5` and `installed_at_path: "ops-vm/**"`. |
| `registries/os-health.yaml` (the eight-attribute metric register, §84.6 line 7471) and `registries/economics.yaml` (the estimate band vocabulary) | L1 | `PARTITION.md` line 17. L4 reads them and publishes content **for** them. `L4-P5-04` fails closed rather than creating `economics.yaml`. |
| Any `.github/workflows/**` file that schedules a nightly ingest or a nightly scan | L2 | `PARTITION.md` line 18. |
| A `records/scorecard/` store, or any addition to the §97.2 store table | L0 decision then L4 Phase 2 | **D-L4-P5-01.** `schemas/records/**` is L4's, but the store list is `L4-P2`'s and the question is L0's. |
| The Ready-queue-miss detector | L4, `L4-P5-05`…`L4-P5-13` | Indexed in `L4-06-tasks.md` §2 rows 70–78. This file builds its input and must not renumber it. |
| The §103 measure computations and the metric register | L4 Phase 7 | `L4-P7-01`…`L4-P7-16`. `source-kinds.yaml` and `devlake-coverage.yaml` are their inputs. |
| A contract change of any kind | L0 | `PARTITION.md` rule 2. A lane files a Contract Change Request; it never edits `contracts/**`. |

**End of L4-05.** Fourteen tasks, three of them ASSISTED, four L0 placeholders shipped in the open, and no artifact in this phase that installs, scrapes or renders anything.
