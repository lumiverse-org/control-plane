# L4 — PHASE 4 — THE ATTENTION LEDGER AND DERIVED METRICS

**Lane:** L4 Records, Events & Metrics (subsystems I, N — Master Spec §99.2, lines 9184–9231)
**Phase:** 4 — the attention ledger, its duration rule, and the metrics derived from it
**Phase branch:** `lane/4/04-attention-ledger` (one branch for the phase, one commit per task, one PR at the end — the convention `lane/4/00-charter-preflight`, `lane/4/02-record-schemas` and `lane/4/03-write-paths` established)
**Task ID range:** `L4-T401` … `L4-T418` (18 tasks)
**Authority:** `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Code/implementation/PARTITION.md` is FROZEN and wins over this file. `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Code/implementation/lanes/L4-00-charter.md` is the lane charter; its §3 owned-path list, §9 decisions and §12 standing rules bind every task here.
**Spec of record:** `C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md` (10,214 lines). Every line number below was located with `grep`/`sed` and is cited, not inferred.

## 1. The one defect this phase closes

Master Spec §101.7, invariant 46, line 9514:

> **Derived data is computed, never hand-maintained. Metrics derive from the canonical record stores of Section 97 (Records, Events and Data Conventions), never from hand-maintained numbers.**

§97.1, line 8838, states the shipping test that follows from it:

> Metrics derive from these stores, never from hand-maintained numbers, and **every dashboard metric names the record store it derives from.**

And D102, line 10195, names the specific hole this phase fills:

> The derivation functions the measurement layer rests on are specified rather than assumed. **Attention-hour duration had named sources and no duration rule**, and §99.3 listed the matter closed … Each is defined once, with the calibrated-configuration convention and a stated initial value.

Phase 1 built the stores. Phase 2 built the shapes. Phase 3 built the doors. **Phase 4 builds the one instrument that reads through all three** — the attention ledger — and gives it the duration rule D102 says it never had: a named activity session, a named maximum inter-event gap, a named daily cap, a named precedence order, each a calibrated configuration key with a stated initial value.

Three further spec facts make this phase load-bearing:

| Fact | Spec anchor |
|---|---|
| The Human Attention Hour is the common currency of Part VIII — capacity, utilisation, Product Load Unit, forecasting and staffing diagnosis all denominate in it | §67.1, line 5575 |
| §99.2's dependency spine: *"I is the feedstock for nearly all governance-tier and people-tier computation"* | §99.2, line 9209 |
| §99.6 risk 2: *"Evidence-plumbing gap — dashboards ship empty or drift into hand-maintenance if the record stores are not built early"* | §99.6, lines 9276–9294 |

---

## 2. Fixed workspace convention (binding for every task in this file)

```bash
set -euo pipefail
export CP_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
export CPR_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane-records"
export SPEC="C:/D_Drive/PS/MultiProduct/Research/MultiProduct_MasterSpec_v4.0.md"
```

Re-export these at the start of **every** task. The Bash tool resets the working directory between calls; always use absolute paths.

**Runtime, fixed — do not substitute.** Every executable this phase ships runs under `python3` from `PATH`, importing only the standard library plus **PyYAML**. It does **not** use the `.l4-venv` of Phase 2, because `metrics/attention/test-derivation.sh` — already written by `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` task `L4-P7-T09` — invokes `python3 "$CP/metrics/attention/derive.py"` literally. A `derive.py` that needs a virtualenv fails that suite. No `jsonschema` import appears anywhere in this phase.

**Paths this phase writes — nothing else:**

| Repository | Path | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `control-plane` | `metrics/attention/**` | L4-T402 … L4-T414 |
| `control-plane` | `tools/records/rqm-contract.yaml` | L4-T416 |
| `control-plane` | `tools/records/rqm-detect` | L4-T417 |

Nothing is written to `control-plane-records` in this phase. Nothing is written under `metrics/register/`, `metrics/signals/` or `metrics/taxonomy/`.

### 2.1 Files this phase MUST NOT write — already claimed by a sibling L4 document

A sibling document already owns each path below. Creating any of them here is a duplicate authorship that conflicts at merge, and is a STOP.

| Path | Owner document | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics/attention/test-derivation.sh` | `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` | `L4-P7-T09` |
| `tools/records/fixtures/attention/input/**` | `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` | `L4-P7-T09` |
| `tools/records/fixtures/attention/expected/**` | `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` | `L4-P7-T09` |
| `tools/records/fixtures/rqm/**` | `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` | `L4-P7-T10` |
| `tools/records/test/suite-06-rqm.sh` | `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` | `L4-P7-T10` |
| `tools/records/test-rqm-detector.sh` | `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` | `L4-P7-T10` |
| `tools/records/rqm-emit`, `board-emit`, `lib/emit.sh` | `L4-03-write-paths.md` | `L4-T305`, `L4-T309` |
| `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml` | `L4-02-record-schemas.md` | `L4-T203` |
| `metrics/register/**`, `metrics/signals/**` | the metric-register phase | — |

This phase's own self-check fixtures therefore live under **`metrics/attention/selfcheck/`**, a path no sibling claims (L4-T412).

### 2.2 Consumers of this phase's output — the contracts that bind it

Two artifacts written by `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` already fix the command-line and JSON contract of two executables this phase produces. **Those contracts are input to this phase, not output of it.** They may not be varied.

| Executable | Fixed by | Invocation, literal |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics/attention/derive.py` | `L4-P7-T09`, `L4-P7-T12` | `python3 derive.py --input <f.yaml> [--input …] [--query-product <p>] --json` |
| `tools/records/rqm-detect` | `L4-P7-T10` | `rqm-detect --input <f.yaml> --json` |

The exact output shapes are transcribed in §6 (L4-T411) and §7 (L4-T417) below.

## 3. THE ATTENTION LEDGER — normative tables

### 3.1 The eight categories — closed set (§67.2, lines 5579–5591)

§67.2 line 5579, binding: *"Every attention hour carries exactly one of eight categories. The attention ledger and the utilisation composition (Section 70) use this identical taxonomy; **no parallel category set exists anywhere in the operating system**."*

| # | Category | Covers (§67.2 verbatim, line) | Precedence rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Engineering** | Implementation, including directing AI agents (5583) | 4 |
| 2 | **Review** | Gate 2 review and cross-review (5584) | 3 |
| 3 | **Verification** | Verification-contract authoring, UAT, release verification (5585) | 2 |
| 4 | **Planning** | Gate 1, sequencing, Ready-queue preparation, reviewer-matrix upkeep (5586) | 6 |
| 5 | **Architecture** | Architecture-class work, design, decision records (5587) | 5 |
| 6 | **Incident** | Incident response, coordination, postmortem (5588) | 1 |
| 7 | **Operational** | Releases, deployments, environments, support duties, restore tests (5589) | 7 |
| 8 | **Coordination** | Status, handover, clarification, meetings, interrupts (5590) | 8 |

**Two flags, never a ninth category.**

| Flag | Rule | Spec anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `unplanned` | Work that entered H1 without preparation in H2. *"Unplanned is a flag on an entry, never a ninth category; an unplanned incident hour is still an Incident hour"* | §67.2, line 5592 |
| `ritual` | Set on any entry belonging to a ritual in the §57.2 inventory, *"set by the workflow or record that opens that ritual and **never self-reported**"* | §97.4, line 8956; §57.2, line 4960 |

**Founder coordination time is not a category.** §67.2 line 5594: *"It is the sum of Coordination-category hours attributed to the Founder."*

### 3.2 The per-category source map (§97.4 table, lines 8960–8967) — normative

The middle column is the §97.4 wording, verbatim. The right-hand columns are this phase's mechanical resolution of that wording onto artifacts that exist: L4 record stores (§97.2, lines 8845–8862) and tracked-event phrases from the §97.3 list (line 8951). This table is the human-readable face of `metrics/attention/sources.yaml`, built in L4-T403. Where the two differ, the YAML file is authoritative and the difference is a blocker for L0.

| Category | §97.4 "Derived from", verbatim | Record stores | §97.3 tracked-event phrases (line 8951) | Line |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Engineering | Authored commits and PR activity windows on owned products, including agent-directing sessions | — | `execute started`; `PR opened with agent_authored flag`; `merge` | 8960 |
| Review | PR review sessions: review-requested to review-submitted activity windows, Gate 2 and cross-review | — | `review requested`; `Gate 2 approval with reviewer role` | 8961 |
| Verification | UAT record execution windows, verification-contract commits, CI failure triage sessions, release sign-off events | `records/uat/`; `records/launches/` | `UAT executed with result`; `CI pass or fail per check`; `parity check result`; `launch readiness signed off` | 8962 |
| Planning | Gate 1 activity, planning-board transitions, Ready-queue refill sessions, Horizon 3 board work | `records/estimates/` | `plan approved (Gate 1) with agent_authored flag`; `moved to Ready`; `Ready-queue miss recorded`; `re-plan triggered` | 8963 |
| Architecture | Architecture-class review activity, architecture decision records, cross-product design sessions | `records/decisions/` | `change class assigned`; `platform change proposed` | 8964 |
| Incident | Incident-record participation windows, from response to resolution, plus postmortem authoring | `records/incidents/`; `records/postmortems/` | `incident opened with severity`; `incident resolved`; `postmortem completed` | 8965 |
| Operational | Deployment approvals and executions, restore tests, asset and dependency sweeps, ops-VM maintenance | `records/deployments/`; `records/restore-tests/` | `production approval granted with approver`; `production deployed with digest`; `restore test executed with result`; `credential rotated` | 8966 |
| Coordination | Standups, handovers, demo records and client-facing sessions, status conversations, unplanned interrupts | `records/demos/` | `status request received (Coordination category)`; `plan submitted-to-approver notification sent` | 8967 |

**Binding rule, from §97.1 line 8838.** A category naming neither a record store nor a tracked-event phrase **does not ship**: it is absent from `sources.yaml`, not present-and-flagged. All eight name at least one. `validate-attention-config.sh` (L4-T405) proves it.

**Engineering and Review name no record store by design.** Their §97.4 wording is *commits* and *PR review sessions* — the git and pull-request surface, ingested by DevLake (§99.2 subsystem I, line 9196). Both name tracked-event phrases that `events/` carries, so both ship. The DevLake ingest itself is a separate dependency; see §5, routed item R1.

### 3.3 THE DURATION RULE — what D102 says was missing, defined once

§97.4 line 8969, binding, verbatim:

> A named interval — a review window, an incident window, a Gate 1 window — bounds the *search* for attention; **it is never itself the duration**. Within the interval, the person's attributed events cluster into **activity sessions**: consecutive events separated by no more than the **idle gap** belong to one session, and a wider gap ends it. A session's duration is the span from its first event to its last; a single-event session counts as one granularity unit. Elapsed wall-clock time between an interval's bounds is never an attention hour — a pull request left open overnight is one short session, not fourteen hours of Review.

Seven rules follow. Each is a numbered rule with a name, and every threshold in them is **calibrated configuration with a stated initial value** (D102, line 10195).

| # | Rule | Definition, binding | Spec line |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DR-1** | **Activity session** | The maximal run of a person's attributed events within one window in which every consecutive pair is separated by **no more than** the idle gap. Sessions do not span windows. | 8969 |
| **DR-2** | **Idle gap** — the named maximum inter-event gap, equivalently the idle timeout that ends a session | Calibrated configuration. **Initial value 30 minutes.** A gap *equal to* the idle gap continues the session; a gap *wider than* it ends the session and opens the next. | 8971 |
| **DR-3** | **Session duration** | First event to last event. A single-event session has span zero and is raised to one granularity unit by DR-4. Interval bounds are never a duration. | 8969 |
| **DR-4** | **Granularity** | Calibrated configuration. **Initial value 0.25 hours**, rounded to **nearest**, **never to zero**: `units = round_half_away(span_hours / 0.25)`, and `units < 1` is raised to `1`. | 8972 |
| **DR-5** | **Category precedence** | A session falling inside two windows resolves in this fixed order and **the losing categories receive nothing**: `Incident, Verification, Review, Engineering, Architecture, Planning, Operational, Coordination`. Two windows contain the same session when their event-timestamp signatures are identical. The losing category is recorded with `0.0` hours, not omitted. | 8973 |
| **DR-6** | **Product attribution** | One product touched → that product. Several → split by **event count**. None → `portfolio`. | 8974 |
| **DR-7** | **Daily reconciliation** | Derived hours for a person on a day never exceed that person's scheduled availability for that day (§69.2). Sessions truncate in **reverse precedence order** — `Coordination, Operational, Planning, Architecture, Engineering, Review, Verification, Incident` — until the reconciliation holds, and **each truncation is recorded**. | 8975 |

And the instrument-defect rule, §97.4 line 8976, which is not a duration rule but the failure mode of one:

> A day whose derived hours exceed scheduled availability **before** truncation is an **instrument defect**, not a workload finding. It raises a drift finding against the ledger and never enters a Capacity Profile, a workload state (Section 83) or the Founder view.

### 3.4 The calibrated-configuration register — every threshold, with its initial value

Built as `metrics/attention/calibration.yaml` in L4-T404. **No threshold in this phase is a literal in code**: every one is read from this file, and `validate-attention-config.sh` proves that no numeric literal for a threshold appears in any `metrics/attention/*.py` file.

| Key | Initial value | Kind | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| `idle_gap_minutes` | `30` | calibrated | §97.4 line 8971, verbatim |
| `granularity_hours` | `0.25` | calibrated | §97.4 line 8972, verbatim |
| `granularity_rounding` | `nearest` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8972, verbatim |
| `granularity_never_zero` | `true` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8972, verbatim |
| `precedence_order` | the eight of DR-5 | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8973, verbatim |
| `daily_cap_source` | `capacity_profile.scheduled_availability` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8975; §69.2 line 5720 |
| `day_boundary_timezone` | `person.work_arrangement.timezone` | fixed by spec | §7.3 line 628; §97.1 line 8839 |
| `truncation_order` | `reverse_precedence` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8975 |
| `truncation_tiebreak` | `latest_session_first` | **declared by phase 4** | §97.4 line 8975 names the category order and is silent on the order within a category; the declaration is the authority, not an executor choice |
| `rounding_order` | `round_then_split` | **declared by phase 4** | Source: §84.6 (spec L7892). Rounding order: floor for quotients, round-half-up for final totals. Pinned by `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` **D-L4-P7-03** default; see §5 |
| `self_report_cadence` | `weekly` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8980; §67.3 line 5601 |
| `self_report_unit` | `band` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8980 |
| `self_report_per_product_attribution` | `false` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8980, *"unattributed to any product"* |
| `self_report_cap_minutes_per_person_per_week` | `5` | fixed by spec | §67.3 line 5603; §97.4 line 8980 |
| `self_report_bands` | seven bands, L4-T404 | **declared by phase 4** | §97.4 line 8980 requires bands and names none; the shape is §29.3's band-label-plus-representative-point convention (line 2665) |
| `calibration_phase` | `G3` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8978 |
| `calibration_min_parallel_reporters` | `2` | fixed by spec | §97.4 line 8978, *"at least two people band-report a single week in parallel"* |
| `threshold_review_months` | `12` | calibrated | §84.6 line 7478, *"reviewed every six or twelve months"* — the longer of the two stated values |

### 3.5 Scheduled availability — the daily cap's input, resolved

§97.4 line 8975 caps against *"that person's scheduled availability for that day in the Capacity Profile (Section 69.2)"*. §69.2 line 5720 gives that field exactly one source:

| Capacity Profile field | Source | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduled availability for the period | `work_arrangement` in `people.yaml` — schedule, `fte`, timezone, public-holiday set (§7.3) | Declared |

So the chain is: **§97.4 line 8975 → §69.2 line 5720 → §7.3 (D111, line 10209)**. `work_arrangement` is a real block on the person record (§7 example, lines 568–580), and L1 has already frozen its schema (`L1-00-charter.md` line 281; `L1-05-tasks.md` task `L1-104`). L4 **reads** `registries/people.yaml`; it never writes it (charter §3.1).

**Resolved conflicts — do not re-open.**

| Apparent conflict | Resolution | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| §97.1 line 8839 says the working calendar is *"held in the leave records (Section 6.4)"*; §7.3 puts `work_arrangement` on the person record | Both hold, for different things. §7.3 line 627: *"Leave and schedule are different declarations and neither substitutes for the other."* The **schedule** is `work_arrangement`; the **absence** is the leave record; the **company calendar and public-holiday list per location** are the leave records (§6.4 line 451; §52.6 line 4641). | D111, line 10209 |
| §6.4 line 453 says *"A person record never stores calendar detail"* | D111 is the later governing decision and states the `work_arrangement` block exists precisely because *"no section defined it and no control-plane file held it"*. L1 has implemented it. | D111, line 10209; `L1-02-schemas.md` §`work_arrangement` |

**Resolution order for `scheduled-availability.py` (L4-T406), fixed:**

| # | Condition | Result |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | person absent from `people.yaml` | `SCHEDAVAIL ERROR person-not-in-registry`, exit 3 |
| R2 | person has no `work_arrangement` block | `SCHEDAVAIL ERROR no-work-arrangement`, exit 3 — fail closed, matching L1's `R07.4` |
| R3 | an approved leave record covers the date | `0.0` |
| R4 | the date is in the public-holiday list for the person's `public_holiday_set` | `0.0` |
| R5 | the date's weekday is absent from `work_arrangement.schedule` | `0.0` (§7.3 line 571: *"omit a day to declare it non-working"*) |
| R6 | otherwise | `(end − start)` in hours, in the person's declared IANA timezone, times the `fte_application` factor |
| R7 | any input unparseable or absent | `SCHEDAVAIL ERROR <reason>`, exit 3. **Never a default number.** |

---

## 4. Phase entry conditions

Task **L4-T401** proves every row. If any row fails, no other task in this phase starts.

| # | Condition | Why | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | `control-plane` is a git repository and `metrics/` exists | Charter L4-T004 | `test -d` |
| E2 | `$CP_ROOT/contracts/registry/event-types.v1.yaml` exists | §97.3 line 8959 — the ledger's event sources are typed | `test -f` |
| E3 | `$CP_ROOT/tools/records/rqm-emit` exists and is executable | Phase 3 L4-T309 — the detector emits through it | `test -x` |
| E4 | `python3` is on PATH and can `import yaml` | Every executable this phase ships | exit 0 |
| E5 | `$CP_ROOT/tools/records/lane-selfcheck.sh` exists and is executable | Charter L4-T005 | `test -x` |
| E6 | `$CP_ROOT/metrics/attention/test-derivation.sh` does **not** exist yet | §2.1 — it is `L4-P7-T09`'s file, written after this phase | `test ! -f` |

If E2 or E3 fail, the phase that owns them has not merged. **Do not create them here.** If E6 fails, a later phase has already merged and this phase is out of order. Open the blocker in L4-T401.

---

## 5. DECISION REQUIRED — hand to L0

Four items. **No L4 executor may answer them.** Each blocks only what it names; everything else in the phase proceeds. Charter decisions **D-L4-01**, **D-L4-02**, **D-L4-03**, Phase-3 decisions **D-L4-P3-01/02/03**, and `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` decisions **D-L4-P7-01/02/03** are closed — see `_DECISION_SIGNOFF.md`.

**Closed elsewhere:** **D-L4-P7-03** (round-then-split) — decided, see `_DECISION_SIGNOFF.md`. This phase's `calibration.yaml` carries `rounding_order: round_then_split` with `decided: D-L4-P7-03`. Fixtures that distinguish the two orders may now be added.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P4-01 — does `fte` multiply the declared schedule, or is it already in it?

- **Fact:** §7.3 line 629: *"`fte` is a capacity multiplier, not a status."* §7 line 577, on the same block: `fte: 1.0  # 0 < fte <= 1; part-time is configuration`. §7.3 line 571 declares the per-weekday `schedule` with explicit `start`/`end`. A part-time person can be expressed either way — a short `schedule` with `fte: 1.0`, or a full `schedule` with `fte: 0.5` — and applying both halves a half-day twice.
- **Question:** In computing scheduled availability for one day, is the declared `schedule` span multiplied by `fte`, or is `fte` an aggregate-period multiplier that the per-day figure must not apply?
- **Blocks:** rule **R6** of `scheduled-availability.py` (L4-T406) only. Every attention fixture supplies `scheduled_availability_hours` directly, so no derivation and no test is blocked.
- **L4 default until answered:** `calibration.yaml` declares `fte_application: none` with `decided: D-L4-P4-01`, and `scheduled-availability.py` reads the factor from that key. `none` means the declared `schedule` span is authoritative and `fte` is **not** applied a second time, grounded in line 577's *"part-time is configuration"*.
- **L4 must not:** hard-code either behaviour, write to `registries/people.yaml`, or infer a schedule from activity (§7.2 line 619: leave *"is never inferred from activity"*).

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P4-02 — the Ready-queue-miss event is appended before three of its six fields exist

- **Fact:** §97.5 line 8984: the board automation *"appends a Ready-queue-miss event with who, which date, and which product, **and opens a one-line cause prompt** for the Team Lead"*. §97.5 line 8986: the event *"carries the full Section 29.4 field set … the last three supplied by the cause prompt, never inferred."* Phase 3's `tools/records/rqm-emit` (task `L4-T309`) **refuses a verdict document missing any of the eight keys**, `queue_empty_reason`, `team_lead_blocked` and `priority_changed_recently` included. An event cannot be appended at detection time and also carry fields that do not exist yet.
- **Question:** Does the event wait for the cause prompt to be answered, or is it appended immediately and completed by a follow-up record (§97.2 line 8890: *"corrections are follow-up records"*)? If the second, which store carries the follow-up?
- **Blocks:** the `--emit` path of `rqm-detect` (L4-T417) only. Classification, the `--json` verdict and the whole of `L4-P7-T10`'s suite are unaffected — that suite never calls `--emit`.
- **L4 default until answered:** `rqm-detect --emit` writes the `rqm-emit` verdict document **only** when `cause_prompt_answered` is true. When it is false it prints `RQM-DETECT PENDING-CAUSE <case>` on stdout, exits `0`, writes no verdict file and appends no event. It never fabricates a cause, a `team_lead_blocked` or a `priority_changed_recently`.
- **L4 must not:** modify `tools/records/rqm-emit` (Phase 3's file), relax its eight-key requirement, or infer any of the three cause fields.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P4-03 — which leave record carries the company working calendar

- **Fact:** §6.4 line 451 and §52.6 line 4641 both place the company working calendar — operating timezone, standard working days, core-hours window and *"the public-holiday list per location"* — in the leave records. There are now two calendars: (1) the company working calendar in the leave records, and (2) per-person `work_arrangement` schedule. `work_arrangement.public_holiday_set` is a reference to the company calendar, not a second independent list. `L4-02-record-schemas.md` gives `leave.schema.json` those fields plus a calendar **version** (`L4-06-tasks.md` row `L4-P2-22`). Neither the spec nor Phase 2 states **which** record in `records/leave/` is the current calendar, or how a reader selects it.
- **Question:** By what rule does a reader select the calendar-carrying leave record — a fixed filename, the highest calendar `version`, the latest effective date, or another rule L0 names?
- **Blocks:** rule **R4** of `scheduled-availability.py` (L4-T406) only, and only in production wiring. No fixture and no test is blocked.
- **L4 default until answered:** `scheduled-availability.py` takes the calendar document as a **required explicit argument** `--calendar <path>`. It never searches `records/leave/`, never picks a record by resemblance, and exits `3` with `SCHEDAVAIL ERROR no-calendar` when the argument is absent.
- **L4 must not:** invent a filename convention under `records/leave/`, or fall back to a hard-coded holiday list.

### DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P4-04 — the Capacity Profile has no lane

- **Fact:** §97.4 line 8975 caps derived hours against *"that person's scheduled availability for that day **in the Capacity Profile** (Section 69.2)"*, and line 8976 says an instrument-defect day *"never enters a Capacity Profile, a workload state (Section 83) or the Founder view"*. The Capacity Profile, workload states and the whole people-intelligence surface are §99.2 subsystem **P** (line 9203), which **PARTITION.md v1 assigns to no lane** — the known partition gap already escalated by other authors, alongside G, H, J and O. L4 does not claim it.
- **Question:** Which lane owns subsystem P, and therefore owns the consumer that must honour `capacity_profile_eligible`, `workload_state_eligible` and `founder_view_eligible`?
- **Blocks:** nothing in this phase. This phase **emits** the three eligibility flags and the recorded truncations; it builds no Capacity Profile, no workload state and no Founder view.
- **L4 default until answered:** `derive.py` emits `capacity_profile_eligible`, `workload_state_eligible` and `founder_view_eligible` as declared output fields, and `metrics/attention/HANDOFF-P.md` (L4-T413) names them for whoever receives subsystem P. **L4 writes no file under any path subsystem P would own.**
- **L4 must not:** claim subsystem P, build a Capacity Profile, or render a Founder view.

**Routed dependencies — stated, not claimed.**

| # | Item | Needed for | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | DevLake ingest of commit and PR activity (§99.2 subsystem I, line 9196; run on the operations VM, subsystem M, line 9200) | The Engineering and Review windows of §3.2 in production. Not needed for any fixture. | Ops VM is L5 (`ops-vm/**`, PARTITION.md line 21). The ingest contract is an L0 routing question. |
| R2 | The `event_type` identifier for each tracked-event phrase in §3.2 | `sources.yaml` validation | `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml`, Phase 2 task `L4-T203`. This phase **looks identifiers up**; it never declares one (charter §12 rule 3). |
| R3 | Drift finding for an instrument-defect day (§97.4 line 8976) | The defect must reach an operator | `validators/drift/**` is L3 (PARTITION.md line 19). L4 emits the flag; L3 raises the finding. |

**STOP rule** — if any value differs from the expected block above: **do not create the missing artifact yourself.** `TAXONOMY=no` or `RQMEMIT=no` means an earlier L4 phase has not merged to `integration`; creating them here duplicates another phase's authorship and will conflict at merge. `TESTPHASE=present` means `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` merged before this phase and the merge train ran out of order — stop, because this phase would then be writing against a suite it was supposed to precede. `PYYAML=no` is a runner-image matter for L0.

**STOP rule** — if `CANARY` is not `ATTNCFG OK selftest 1/1`, the validator accepted a ninth category and is decoration, not a check (charter §12 rule 10). If `MISSING` is not `3`, the validator returns a pass when it cannot reach its input; §40.1 line 3671 requires a check that cannot reach its input to **fail closed rather than reporting zero**. Do not relax a rule in the validator to make `MAIN` pass — a `FAIL` here means an earlier task's transcription is wrong. Open a blocker issue:

### L4-T406 — Scheduled availability, the daily cap's input

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T404

Implements the seven-row resolution table of §3.5 and nothing else. The chain is §97.4 line 8975 → §69.2 line 5720 → §7.3 `work_arrangement` (D111, line 10209). This script **reads** `registries/people.yaml`; it never writes it.

**Every input is an explicit argument. There is no search, no fallback and no default number.** Five arguments are required — `--person`, `--date`, `--people`, `--calendar`, `--absence` — and a missing one is `SCHEDAVAIL ERROR`, exit `3`. `--calendar` is required because **D-L4-P4-03** is open: no rule yet selects the calendar-carrying record out of `records/leave/`, so the caller names the document. `--absence` is required for the same reason and takes this phase's own two-key contract, **not** a leave-record schema — L4 does not read `leave.schema.json` field names here, because inventing one would be a design decision.

The two input documents this script defines. They are **its own contract**, not record schemas:

```yaml
# --calendar <path>                    # --absence <path>
calendar_version: 1                    person: dev-a
public_holiday_sets:                   dates: [2026-09-17]
  IN: [2026-01-26, 2026-08-15]
```

**The declared span is wall-clock local time and needs no timezone database.** `work_arrangement.schedule.mon.start` and `.end` are declared local clock times (§7.3 line 572), so `end − start` is the span whatever the offset that day. The `timezone` field is therefore **format-checked only** — it must be an IANA identifier, never a UTC offset (§7.3 line 628) — and no `zoneinfo` or `pytz` import appears anywhere. Nothing in this script resolves an instant to a day; `derive.py` (L4-T411) takes the day from the input's declared `date` field and never computes one.

The dates are chosen so that each row exercises exactly one rule: 2026-09-14 is a Monday (declared, R6, `09:30`–`18:30` = 9.0 hours); 2026-09-15 is a Tuesday declared as a holiday above (R4); 2026-09-16 is a Wednesday absent from the schedule (R5); 2026-09-17 is a Thursday covered by the absence document (R3).

**STOP rule** — if `R2` is not `SCHEDAVAIL ERROR no-work-arrangement`, the script has defaulted a schedule for a person who declared none, and every capacity figure downstream inherits a number nobody wrote; §7.3's coverage-check limb (line 630) requires that validator to **fail closed** where a member has no work arrangement, and this is the same rule. If `R6` is not `9.0`, either `fte` is being applied on top of a declared span — which is exactly what **D-L4-P4-01** exists to stop — or the span is being resolved through a timezone database. **Do not change `fte_application` in `calibration.yaml` to make a number come out**; a calibration value is refitted at a §84.6 line 7478 review, never edited during a build.

### L4-T407 — The duration rule, part 1: config reader, activity session, idle gap, granularity

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T404, L4-T405

Rules **DR-1**, **DR-2**, **DR-3** and **DR-4** of §3.3, and nothing else. Two files, both under `metrics/attention/lib/`.

**Binding mechanics, so nothing is chosen at the keyboard:**

| Rule | Mechanical statement | Spec line |
|---|---|---|
| DR-1 | A session is a maximal run within **one window**. Sessions never span windows. | 8969 |
| DR-2 | `next − previous <= idle_gap` continues the session; `>` opens a new one. The comparison is `<=`, so a gap of exactly the idle gap does **not** split — §97.4 line 8969 says *"separated by no more than the idle gap"*. | 8971 |
| DR-3 | `span = last_event − first_event`. A `bounds` pair is read **only** to drop events outside it, and never contributes a second to any duration. | 8969 |
| DR-4 | `units = floor(span_hours / granularity + 0.5)` — round half **away from zero**, which Python's built-in `round()` does **not** do — then `units = max(units, 1)`. | 8972 |

**There is deliberately no `lib/__init__.py`.** Callers put `metrics/attention/lib` on `sys.path` and import the modules by name. An `__init__.py` would be a `.py` file under `metrics/attention/` mentioning neither `calibration.yaml` nor `load_calibration`, and check **C8** of `validate-attention-config.sh` (L4-T405) would fail the phase.

```

`HALF` is the rounding proof: `0.375 / 0.25 = 1.5`, and half away from zero gives `2` grains, so `0.5`. Python's built-in `round(1.5)` is `2` but `round(2.5)` is also `2`, which is why `math.floor(x + 0.5)` is written out rather than `round()` being trusted. `BOUNDSIGNORED` is the DR-3 proof: the 12:00 event lies outside the declared bounds and is dropped, and the two-hour bounds themselves contribute nothing.

**STOP rule** — if `BOUNDARY` is not `1`, the comparison is `<` where §97.4 line 8969 says *"no more than"*, and every session in the portfolio silently fragments into shorter ones. If `SINGLE` is not `0.25`, the never-zero limb of line 8972 is not implemented and single-event sessions vanish from the ledger entirely. If `CFG` is not `ATTNCFG OK …`, check **C8** of L4-T405 has found a `.py` file under `metrics/attention/` that neither mentions `calibration.yaml` nor imports `load_calibration` — **add the import; never remove check C8** (charter §12 rule 10).

### L4-T408 — The duration rule, part 2: category precedence (DR-5)

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T407

Rule **DR-5** of §3.3. §97.4 line 8973 fixes the order and the outcome: *"a session falling inside two windows resolves in this fixed order and the losing categories receive nothing."* §67.1 line 5573 is why: exactly one category always receives the hour.

**Two mechanical statements the executor must not vary:**

1. **Same session** means **identical event-timestamp signature** — the tuple of the session's event instants, in order. Windows whose signatures differ are different sessions and both are counted; no partial overlap is resolved, because line 8973 speaks of a session falling inside two windows, not of two different sessions.
2. **The loser is recorded at `0.0`, for the same products, never omitted.** A category dropped from the output is indistinguishable from a category with no work, and §84.6 line 7471's `expected_interpretation` attribute becomes unreadable. The fixture `DC-4` (`L4-P7-T09`) asserts `Review: {alpha: 0.0}` present.

```

(`none` is two events 45 minutes apart — one session under a 30-minute idle gap? No: 45 > 30, so it is **two** sessions and `[0]` is the first. The split is being exercised, not the sessioniser; the `0.75` passed in is the hours argument, not a derived span.)

**STOP rule** — if `NONE` is not `{'portfolio': 0.75}` the portfolio limb of line 8974 is missing and every session with no product silently disappears from the ledger rather than landing on the portfolio. If `REFUSE` is not `1`, the module has a second code path for a rounding order **L0 has not chosen** — delete it. Do not add a fixture that distinguishes the two orders (§5, `D-L4-P7-03`).

### L4-T410 — The duration rule, part 4: daily reconciliation and the instrument defect (DR-7)

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T404, L4-T406

Rule **DR-7** of §3.3 and the instrument-defect rule of §97.4 line 8976. This is the task the per-person daily cap of the brief lands in.

**Binding mechanics:**

| Statement | Spec line |
|---|---|
| The cap is that person's scheduled availability for that day, resolved by L4-T406 through §69.2 line 5720 to `work_arrangement` (§7.3). | 8975 |
| Truncation runs in **reverse precedence order** — `Coordination, Operational, Planning, Architecture, Engineering, Review, Verification, Incident` — read from `calibration.yaml`, never written in code. | 8975 |
| **Each truncation is recorded**: a list entry naming the category and the hours removed. A silent truncation is the same instrument failure as a silent zero (§97.2 line 8869). | 8975 |
| A day exceeding the cap **before** truncation is an **instrument defect**, not a workload finding, and never enters a Capacity Profile, a workload state (§83.1, line 7280) or the Founder view (§93). | 8976 |
| The three eligibility flags are **emitted, not consumed, by L4**. Subsystem P owns the consumer and PARTITION v1 assigns it to no lane (§5, `D-L4-P4-04`). | 9203 |

```

**STOP rule** — if `TRUNC` names a category other than `Coordination`, the truncation is not running in reverse precedence order and the ledger is removing Incident hours before Coordination hours, which inverts the meaning of every utilisation composition built on it (§70.1, line 5741). If `DEFECT` is `False` for a day totalling 8.50 against a cap of 8.00, line 8976 is not implemented and an instrument failure is about to be reported to a human as a workload finding about a person — the precise harm §91.2 (lines 8083–8092) and §83 exist to prevent. **Never raise the cap to clear a defect.** Open a blocker issue:

### L4-T411 — `derive.py`, the attention ledger

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T407, L4-T408, L4-T409, L4-T410

The one executable that composes DR-1…DR-7 and the weekly self-report of §97.4 line 8980. **Its command line and its JSON shape are input to this task, not output of it** — `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` tasks `L4-P7-T09` and `L4-P7-T12` already fixed both (§2.2). Nothing below may be varied to taste.

**The three input shapes and the mode each selects, in this order:**

| # | Input carries | Mode | What the mode is |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `self_reports` | self-report | §97.4 line 8980 apportionment, permanent provenance, ritual refusal |
| 2 | `pre_truncation_hours` | day close | DR-7: the daily reconciliation and the instrument-defect flags |
| 3 | `windows` | window derivation | DR-1…DR-6: sessions, precedence, granularity, product split |

Anything else is `ATTN ERROR unrecognised-input-shape`, exit `3`. **Never guess a shape.**

**Window mode does not truncate, and that is deliberate.** §97.4 line 8975 reconciles *"derived hours for a person on a day"* — a day-level operation whose input is the day's totals, which is exactly what day-close mode takes. Window mode derives one window set, emits `truncations: 0`, and still emits `instrument_defect`, which line 8976 defines on the **pre**-truncation total and is therefore well-defined without truncating anything.

**The key-presence rule is read off the fixtures, not chosen.** `L4-P7-T09` compares whole normalised JSON documents, so an extra key fails a case exactly as a wrong number does. `DC-6` carries `truncation_detail` and all three eligibility flags; `DC-7` carries neither. Therefore:

| Key | Emitted when |
|---|---|
| `truncation_detail` | `truncations > 0` |
| `capacity_profile_eligible` | day-close mode, always |
| `workload_state_eligible`, `founder_view_eligible` | day-close mode, and `instrument_defect` is `true` |
| `sessions`, `hours` | window mode only |
| `total_hours`, `hours_by_category` | day-close mode only |
| `apportioned` | self-report mode only |

**`--query-product <p>`** aggregates every window-mode input given on the same command line and emits `{"product": <p>, "hours": <float>}`. `L4-P7-T12` reads `["hours"]` and formats it as `.2f`; over `dc-1`, `dc-3`, `dc-4` and `dc-5` filtered to `alpha` the sum is `1.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.50 = 2.75`, which is the value that suite asserts.

Expected output, exactly:

```
W1={"case": "V-1", "hours": {"Engineering": {"alpha": 1.25}}, "instrument_defect": false, "sessions": 1, "truncations": 0}
W2={"case": "V-2", "hours": {"Incident": {"alpha": 0.75}, "Review": {"alpha": 0.0}}, "instrument_defect": false, "sessions": 1, "truncations": 0}
D1=8.0 1 Coordination 0.5 True False
D2KEYS=capacity_profile_eligible,case,hours_by_category,instrument_defect,total_hours,truncations
SRP=3 3
RITUAL=1
SHAPE=3
QP=2.75
FOREIGN=0
```

`QP` is the AT-044 arithmetic in miniature: `V-1` Engineering `alpha` 1.25 + `V-3` Review `alpha` 0.25 + `V-2` Incident `alpha` 0.75 with Review at 0.00 + `V-4` Engineering `alpha` 0.50, while `V-4`'s `beta` and `gamma` quarters are filtered out. `1.25 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 0.50 = 2.75`.

**STOP rule** — if `W2` omits `"Review": {"alpha": 0.0}`, the losing category is being dropped and fixture `DC-4` of `L4-P7-T09` will fail with no way to localise it. If `D2KEYS` carries `truncation_detail`, `workload_state_eligible` or `founder_view_eligible`, the key-presence rule above is not implemented and `DC-7` fails on an extra key rather than on a wrong number. If `RITUAL` is `0`, a person has been allowed to self-report a flag §67.2 line 5592 says is *"set by the workflow or record that opens the ritual … never self-reported"* — **do not strip the flag and continue; reject the document.** If `QP` is not `2.75`, either the product filter is leaking `beta`/`gamma` or the precedence loser is being counted at more than zero.

### L4-T412 — This phase's own proof: `metrics/attention/selfcheck/`

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T406, L4-T411

`L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` owns `metrics/attention/test-derivation.sh` and everything under `tools/records/fixtures/attention/` (§2.1). **Creating any of those here is a duplicate authorship and a STOP.** This phase proves itself on its own unclaimed path, `metrics/attention/selfcheck/`, so that the ledger can be shown correct before the tests phase exists — §99.6 risk 2 (lines 9276–9294) is that the evidence plumbing ships unproven.

Nine cases. Each isolates one rule, and every expected value below is computed from the spec, stated here, and **asserted, never recomputed**:

| Case | Isolates | Arithmetic | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SC-1` | DR-2 at both sides of the boundary | 09:00→09:30 is a 30-minute gap (one session, span 0.5 h → 2 grains); 09:30→10:01 is 31 minutes (splits); the tail is a single event → 1 grain | sessions **2**, Engineering `alpha` **0.75** |
| `SC-2` | DR-4 never-zero | single event, span 0 → raised to 1 grain | Review `alpha` **0.25** |
| `SC-3` | DR-5 with a non-adjacent pair | span 40 min = 0.6667 h → 3 grains; Incident rank 1 beats Planning rank 6 | Incident **0.75**, Planning **0.00** |
| `SC-4` | DR-6 with an uneven split | span 40 min → 0.75 h; counts `alpha` 1, `beta` 2 of 3 | `alpha` **0.25**, `beta` **0.50** |
| `SC-5` | DR-7 with a cap below 8 h | 3.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 = 7.00 against 6.00; excess 1.00 taken from Coordination | total **6.00**, truncations **1**, defect **true** |
| `SC-6` | DR-7 clean control | 3.00 + 1.00 = 4.00 against 8.00 | truncations **0**, defect **false**, eligible **true** |
| `SC-7` | line 8980 apportionment and portfolio fallback | 3.00 × 0.5 twice; 1.00 with no share | `alpha` **1.5**, `beta` **1.5**, `portfolio` **1.0**, all labelled |
| `SC-8` | line 5592 ritual refusal | — | non-zero exit |
| `SC-9` | L4-T406 R6 | `09:00`–`17:00` on Monday 2026-09-14 | **8.0** |

**Acceptance criteria**

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Eleven inputs, seven expected documents | `ls "$CP_ROOT"/metrics/attention/selfcheck/input/sc-*.yaml \| wc -l; ls "$CP_ROOT"/metrics/attention/selfcheck/expected/*.json \| wc -l` | `11` then `7` |
| 2 | All nine cases pass | `sh "$CP_ROOT/metrics/attention/selfcheck/run.sh" \| tail -1` | `ATTNSELF OK 9/9` |
| 3 | Every case reports individually | `sh "$CP_ROOT/metrics/attention/selfcheck/run.sh" \| grep -c '^PASS SC-'` | `9` |
| 4 | The suite can fail — seeded canary | see SELF-VERIFY `CANARY` | `1` |
| 5 | No file owned by `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` was created | see SELF-VERIFY `NOFOREIGNFILE` | `0` |
| 6 | Only `metrics/attention/` changed | `git -C "$CP_ROOT" diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD \| grep -vc '^metrics/attention/'` | `0` |

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
export CP_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
SC="$CP_ROOT/metrics/attention/selfcheck"
echo "INPUTS=$(ls "$SC"/input/sc-*.yaml | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "EXPECTED=$(ls "$SC"/expected/*.json | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "MAIN=$(sh "$SC/run.sh" | tail -1)"
echo "PASSES=$(sh "$SC/run.sh" | grep -c '^PASS SC-')"
cp "$SC/expected/sc-1.json" "$SC/expected/sc-1.json.bak"
printf '%s\n' '{"case":"SC-1","sessions":1,"hours":{"Engineering":{"alpha":9.99}},"truncations":0,"instrument_defect":false}' > "$SC/expected/sc-1.json"

echo "FOREIGN=$(git -C "$CP_ROOT" diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD | grep -vc '^metrics/attention/')"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
INPUTS=11
EXPECTED=7
MAIN=ATTNSELF OK 9/9
PASSES=9
CANARY=1
RESTORED=ATTNSELF OK 9/9
NOFOREIGNFILE=0
FOREIGN=0
```

**STOP rule** — if `CANARY` is not `1`, the suite passes against a fixture asserting 9.99 hours for a 1.25-hour session and is decoration, not a check (charter §12 rule 10). If `NOFOREIGNFILE` is not `0`, a file belonging to `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` has been created here — delete it, do not keep it, and do not "merge" the two suites. If a case fails, **edit `derive.py`, never the expected document**: the expected values are computed from §97.4 in the table above and a mismatch localises a derivation defect. If `SC-4` fails only in the `alpha`/`beta` proportion, re-read **D-L4-P7-03** — a fixture that distinguishes the two rounding orders must not exist (§5). Open a blocker issue:

### L4-T413 — `HANDOFF-P.md`: what this phase emits for the lane that does not exist

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T411

§97.4 line 8976 names three surfaces an instrument-defect day never enters, and §97.4 line 8975 caps against the Capacity Profile. All three surfaces — Capacity Profile, workload state (§83), Founder view (§93) — are §99.2 subsystem **P** (line 9203), which **PARTITION v1 assigns to no lane**. That is the known partition gap already escalated by other authors alongside G, H, J and O; this task does **not** re-litigate it and does **not** claim P. It writes one document naming exactly what L4 emits, so that whoever receives P inherits a contract rather than a guess.

**This is a document, not a Capacity Profile.** L4 writes no file under any path subsystem P would own.

**Commands**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
export CP_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
cat > "$CP_ROOT/metrics/attention/HANDOFF-P.md" <<'HAND_EOF'
# What the attention ledger emits for subsystem P

Written by lane L4, phase 4 (`implementation/lanes/L4-04-attention-ledger.md`, task L4-T413).
Authority: MasterSpec v4.0 Section 97.4 lines 8975-8976; Section 69.2 line 5720; Section 83.1
line 7280; Section 93; Section 99.2 line 9203.

## The boundary

Subsystem P — people intelligence: capacity profiles, utilisation composition, bandwidth states,
overload and under-utilisation detection, staffing diagnosis (Section 99.2, line 9203) — is
assigned to no lane in PARTITION v1. L4 does not claim it and builds none of it. L4 owns the
ledger; P owns every surface the ledger feeds. See L4-04-attention-ledger.md section 5,
DECISION REQUIRED D-L4-P4-04, routed to L0.

## What L4 emits, and where it comes from

| Emitted field | Emitted by | Meaning | Spec |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hours` / `hours_by_category` | metrics/attention/derive.py | Derived attention hours in the eight-category taxonomy, one category per hour | 67.1 line 5573; 67.2 line 5579 |
| `total_hours` | metrics/attention/derive.py | The person-day total AFTER the daily reconciliation | 97.4 line 8975 |
| `truncations`, `truncation_detail` | metrics/attention/derive.py | Every truncation the reconciliation applied, category and hours removed. "each truncation is recorded" | 97.4 line 8975 |
| `instrument_defect` | metrics/attention/derive.py | The day exceeded scheduled availability BEFORE truncation | 97.4 line 8976 |
| `capacity_profile_eligible` | metrics/attention/derive.py | false on a defect day | 97.4 line 8976 |
| `workload_state_eligible` | metrics/attention/derive.py | false on a defect day; the Section 83 consumer | 97.4 line 8976; 83.1 line 7280 |
| `founder_view_eligible` | metrics/attention/derive.py | false on a defect day; the Section 93 consumer | 97.4 line 8976 |
| `provenance: self-reported` | metrics/attention/derive.py | Carried permanently on any figure including self-reported hours | 97.4 line 8980 |
| `scheduled_availability_hours` | metrics/attention/scheduled-availability.py | The declared cap, from work_arrangement | 69.2 line 5720; 7.3 |

## Four obligations P inherits, each already stated in the spec

1. **Honour the three eligibility flags.** A day with `instrument_defect: true` never enters a
   Capacity Profile, a workload state or the Founder view (line 8976). It is an instrument
   finding, never a workload finding about a person.
2. **Carry the self-reported label wherever the figure renders, permanently** (line 8980).
   Coordination is never presented beside genuinely derived categories without it.
3. **Never render attention hours as individual performance evidence**, and never as a per-person
   drill-down on a general surface. Aggregate at product and portfolio level only
   (Section 67.3 line 5605; Section 91.2 lines 8083-8092).
4. **Declare the eight metric attributes** for anything built on these fields: definition, source,
   time window, baseline, expected interpretation, known limitations, owner, action on breach
   (Section 84.6 line 7471). The ledger's own declared limitation is Section 97.4 line 8978: it is
   a LOWER BOUND on attention, and Architecture and Coordination are systematically under-counted.

## What L4 does NOT emit, and will not

A Capacity Profile; a workload state; a bandwidth state; a Founder view; a utilisation
composition; a staffing diagnosis; any per-person surface. The drift finding a defect day raises
(line 8976) is also not L4's: `validators/drift/**` belongs to L3 (PARTITION.md line 19). L4
emits the flag; L3 raises the finding; P renders nothing until it has an owner.

**Acceptance criteria**

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The document exists | `test -f "$CP_ROOT/metrics/attention/HANDOFF-P.md" && echo YES` | `YES` |
| 2 | All nine emitted fields are named | see SELF-VERIFY `FIELDS` | `9` |
| 3 | The three eligibility flags each appear | see SELF-VERIFY `FLAGS` | `3` |
| 4 | It states the partition gap without claiming P | see SELF-VERIFY `NOCLAIM` | `1 1` |
| 5 | No file was created outside `metrics/attention/` | `git -C "$CP_ROOT" diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD \| grep -vc '^metrics/attention/'` | `0` |

**SELF-VERIFY**

```bash
set -euo pipefail
export CP_ROOT="$HOME/src/control-plane"
H="$CP_ROOT/metrics/attention/HANDOFF-P.md"
echo "EXISTS=$(test -f "$H" && echo yes || echo no)"
echo "FIELDS=$(grep -c '^| \`' "$H")"
echo "FLAGS=$(grep -o 'capacity_profile_eligible\|workload_state_eligible\|founder_view_eligible' "$H" | sort -u | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "NOCLAIM=$(grep -c 'L4 does not claim it' "$H") $(grep -c 'D-L4-P4-04' "$H")"
echo "PPATHS=$(git -C "$CP_ROOT" diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD | grep -c 'capacity\|workload\|founder-view')"
echo "FOREIGN=$(git -C "$CP_ROOT" diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD | grep -vc '^metrics/attention/')"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
EXISTS=yes
FIELDS=9
FLAGS=3
NOCLAIM=1 1
PPATHS=0
FOREIGN=0
```

**STOP rule** — if `PPATHS` is not `0`, a path a subsystem-P owner would own has been created in this lane. Delete it. PARTITION.md rule 1 is *"One owner per path… No exceptions"*, and a lane that claims an unassigned subsystem makes the gap harder to close, not easier. Do **not** build a Capacity Profile "just to test the flags" — the flags are tested by `SC-5` and `SC-6` in L4-T412. Open a blocker issue:

```yaml

### L4-T414 — Every metric names its store, or it does not ship

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T411, L4-T412

§97.1 line 8838, binding: *"Metrics derive from these stores, never from hand-maintained numbers, and every dashboard metric names the record store it derives from. **A metric that cannot name its store does not ship.**"* Invariant 46 (§101.7, line 9514) says the same at the invariant level. This task is the mechanical form of the shipping test, applied to every figure this phase emits.

**Scope, so no second register is created.** This file declares the **ledger's own outputs** — the eleven figures `derive.py`, `scheduled-availability.py` and the Ready-queue-miss detector emit. It is **not** `metrics/register/metric-declarations.yaml`, which belongs to the metric-register phase (§2.1) and holds the §103 success measures. The validator proves the two do not overlap, because §84.6 line 7472 says the register is the carrier and *"the table is a view of it, never a second copy."*

**Every metric id is derived mechanically from an emitted field.** Each row declares exactly one of three provenances, and the validator proves it resolves:

| Provenance | Resolves against | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `output_key` | a key emitted by `derive.py` or `scheduled-availability.py` | the figure exists |
| `taxonomy_flag` | a flag in `metrics/attention/taxonomy.yaml` | §67.2 line 5592 — flags, never a ninth category |
| `event_type` | an identifier in `metrics/taxonomy/event-types.yaml` | §97.3 line 8947 — identifiers are Phase 2's, looked up and never declared here |

**Every row carries the eight §84.6 attributes (line 7471)** — definition, source, time window, baseline, expected interpretation, known limitations, owner, action on breach. `known_limitations` is never empty (§84.6 line 7473). `baseline` is a recorded value **or** the literal `unbaselined` (§103.14 line 9975; D77, line 10160: *"an empty metric store renders as unbaselined, never as a miss"*), which is the half of AT-046 (line 9368) this file satisfies.

If `CANARY` is not `STORENAME OK selftest 1/1`, the shipping test accepts a storeless metric and is decoration, not a check (charter §12 rule 10). If a `duplicate-of-metric-register` failure appears, the metric-register phase has declared the same id — **do not rename either side**; two registers for one metric is exactly what §84.6 line 7472 forbids, and which register owns the id is L0's call.

### L4-T415 — Attention-ledger gate: every check in order, and the phase checkpoint

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T405, L4-T412, L4-T414

**This task creates no file.** It runs the three checks this phase has built, in order, proves the ledger end-to-end, and marks the checkpoint at which the phase stops writing `metrics/attention/` and starts writing `tools/records/`. Everything it runs already exists; if any of it does not, an earlier task did not complete and this task stops.

The gate, in order — a failure at any step stops the phase:

| # | Check | Command | Required last line |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Config agreement | `metrics/attention/validate-attention-config.sh` | `ATTNCFG OK checks=8 categories=8 sources=8` |
| G2 | Config check can fail | `… --selftest` | `ATTNCFG OK selftest 1/1` |
| G3 | Derivation | `metrics/attention/selfcheck/run.sh` | `ATTNSELF OK 9/9` |
| G4 | Store naming | `metrics/attention/validate-store-naming.sh` | `STORENAME OK metrics=11 stored=11 checks=6` |
| G5 | Store-naming check can fail | `… --selftest` | `STORENAME OK selftest 1/1` |
| G6 | Every module compiles | `python3 -m py_compile` over all `.py` | exit `0` |

echo "FOREIGN=$(git -C "$CP_ROOT" diff --name-only origin/integration...HEAD | grep -vc '^metrics/attention/')"
```

Expected output, exactly:

```
G1=ATTNCFG OK checks=8 categories=8 sources=8
G2=ATTNCFG OK selftest 1/1
G3=ATTNSELF OK 9/9

G5=STORENAME OK selftest 1/1
COMPILE=0
PYCACHE=0
DIRTY=0
TAG=1
FILES=15
FOREIGN=0
```

`git ls-files` matches recursively, so `FILES` excludes `selfcheck/` and counts exactly the fifteen files this phase wrote outside it — nine at the top level (`taxonomy.yaml`, `sources.yaml`, `calibration.yaml`, `validate-attention-config.sh`, `validate-store-naming.sh`, `derived-metrics.yaml`, `derive.py`, `scheduled-availability.py`, `HANDOFF-P.md`) and six under `lib/` (`config.py`, `sessions.py`, `precedence.py`, `attribute.py`, `reconcile.py`, `selfreport.py`). `selfcheck/` adds `run.sh`, nine inputs and seven expected documents, proved separately by L4-T412.

**STOP rule** — if `G2` or `G5` is not its `selftest 1/1` line, a validator in this phase cannot fail and is decoration (charter §12 rule 10) — **fix the validator, never the fixture**. If `DIRTY` is not `0`, a task left an uncommitted file; commit it under the task that produced it, never under this one. If `PYCACHE` is not `0`, `__pycache__` has been tracked — remove it from the index and do not add an ignore rule to a root file, because root files belong to L0 (PARTITION.md line 24). Do **not** proceed to L4-T416 with any gate row red. Open a blocker issue:

## 7. THE READY-QUEUE-MISS DETECTOR — normative, and its two tasks

§97.5 (lines 8982–8987) and §29.4 (line 2670) are **one metric**: §29.4 states the condition, §97.5 states the detector. SIG-06 (line 4535) is the count they feed — *"Ready Queue Miss events … 30-day rolling count and trend"*, Planning board, Amber, owner Team Lead. Invariant 15 (line 9471): *"Ready-queue misses trend to zero."*

### 7.1 The classification table — ordered, first match wins

Every row below is quoted from §97.5. The order is the table's order and is **not** a preference: an item whose Blocked flag was just cleared is a resumption whatever else is true of it, so C1 precedes everything.

| # | Condition | Verdict | `limb` | `counts_in_sig06` | Spec line |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `blocked_flag_cleared` is true | `no_miss` | — | `false` | 8984 — *"clearing the flag and resuming the item is a resumption, not a fresh pickup, and is never counted as a miss"* |
| C2 | `transition.from` is `Ready` | `no_miss` | — | `false` | 8984 — *"The Planned column is the normal assignment step (Ready → Planned → In Progress) and passing through it is never a miss"* |
| C3 | `transition.to` is `Done` **and** `ready_queue` is empty | `miss` | `completion_with_empty_ready` | `true` | 8986 — *"Completion with an empty Ready queue counts"* |
| C4 | `transition.to` is `Done` **and** `ready_queue` is non-empty | `no_miss` | — | `false` | 8986 — the idle case is the one that counts; a completion into a stocked queue is not it |
| C5 | `transition.from` is `Backlog`, `to` is `Planned` or `InProgress`, **and** `ready_queue` is empty | `miss` | `pickup_without_ready` | `true` | 8984 — *"a board transition from Backlog directly to Planned or In Progress, or an item started while the product's Ready queue is empty"* |
| C6 | `transition.from` is `Backlog`, `to` is `Planned` or `InProgress`, **and** `ready_queue` is non-empty | `ready_bypass` | `ready_bypass` | `false` | 8986 — *"A bypass with a full Ready queue does not count … recorded with reason `ready_bypass` as a board-hygiene finding … and never enters the SIG-06 count"* |
| C7 | anything else | `no_miss` | — | `false` | the detector is a pickup-and-completion detector; nothing else is a transition it judges |

### 7.2 The verdict document — eight keys, none of them invented

`tools/records/rqm-emit` (Phase 3, task `L4-T309`) already fixes the document it accepts and **refuses any of the eight keys missing or empty**. This phase's detector produces that document and nothing else; it never appends an event and never calls `rqm-emit`. The boundary is the mirror of Phase 3's: *"`rqm-emit` emits; it does not decide"* — **`rqm-detect` decides; it does not emit.**

| Key | Filled from | Cause-prompt field |
|---|---|---|
| `limb` | the classification table above | no |
| `person` | the input's `person` | no |
| `date` | the input's `date` | no |
| `product` | the input's `product` | no |
| `subject_ref` | the input's `subject_ref`, else `null` | no |
| `queue_empty_reason` | the input's field of the same name, else `null` | **yes** |
| `team_lead_blocked` | the input's field of the same name, else `null` | **yes** |
| `priority_changed_recently` | the input's field of the same name, else `null` | **yes** |

**The three cause keys are present only when `cause_prompt_answered` is true.** §97.5 line 8986: *"the last three supplied by the cause prompt, never inferred."* An unanswered prompt therefore yields a five-key record whose key set is a strict subset of the answered one, differing by exactly three — which is how `L4-P7-T10` asserts the §29.4 field set without naming a single field.

**`--emit` writes nothing it knows `rqm-emit` would reject.** `rqm-emit` refuses a key whose value is `None` or `""`, so `--emit` writes the verdict document only when `cause_prompt_answered` is true **and** all eight values are non-null. Otherwise it prints `RQM-DETECT PENDING-CAUSE <case>`, exits `0`, writes no file, and fabricates nothing (§5, **D-L4-P4-02**).

### L4-T417 — `rqm-detect`, the Ready-queue-miss detector

**Size:** L
**Depends on:** L4-T416

The detector §97.5 line 8984 describes. **Its command line and JSON shape are input to this task**: `L4-07-tests-and-runbook.md` task `L4-P7-T10` already calls `rqm-detect --input <f.yaml> --json` and reads `verdict`, `counts_in_sig06` and `record` (§2.2). Charter DoD-8 is that suite's `RQM OK 6/6`.

**This script decides; it does not emit.** It never appends an event, never writes under `records/` or `events/`, and never invokes `rqm-emit`. `--emit <path>` writes **only** the verdict document, for the board automation to hand to `rqm-emit`.

MISSING=3
NORULES=0

```

`PENDING` is correct even though `rq-1.yaml` answers the cause prompt: the fixture supplies no `subject_ref` and no cause text, so three of the eight values are `null` and `rqm-emit` would refuse the document. The detector refuses to write it rather than filling a value in — §97.5 line 8986, *"never inferred."*

**STOP rule** — if `RQ3` or `RQ4` reports `miss`, the detector counts the normal assignment step or a resumption as a miss; §97.5 line 8984 excludes both by name, and an over-reporting detector makes invariant 15 (*"Ready-queue misses trend to zero"*, line 9471) unmeasurable. If `RQ6` is not `ready_bypass False`, board hygiene is being counted in SIG-06, which line 8986 forbids. If `FIELDSET` is not `SUBSET 3`, the three cause-prompt fields are being emitted when unanswered — which means they are being **inferred**, the one thing line 8986 prohibits. **Never change a fixture's `ready_queue` to make a case pass, and never edit `tools/records/rqm-emit`.** Open a blocker issue:

Documents `tools/records/record-decision` CLI and its core library `tools/records/lib/decision.py`. Opening a decision prompt writes to `records/decisions/pending/`; deciding writes a final decision to `records/decisions/` and marks the pending record superseded by a follow-up record, never by in-place mutation (§97.2 lines 8865–8866; §99.2).

**Size:** M
**Depends on:** L4-T411

Documents `tools/records/read-across` and `tools/records/test-read-across.sh` (charter DoD-16). Cross-repository reader fails closed rather than reporting false zeros if the records repository is unreachable (§40.1 line 3671). When unreachable, the reader prints `FAIL-CLOSED` and exits non-zero; `test-read-across.sh --unreachable` asserts this fail-closed exit and exits 1.

**Commands**

```bash
bash tools/records/test-read-across.sh --unreachable
```

**Acceptance criteria**

| # | Criterion | Proving command | Unambiguous output |

## 10. What Phase 4 hands to the other lanes

| Artifact | Consumer | Consumed as |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics/attention/derive.py` | **L4 phase 7** | The executable `metrics/attention/test-derivation.sh` (`L4-P7-T09`) and `tools/records/test/suite-at.sh` (`L4-P7-T12`) invoke |
| `tools/records/rqm-detect` | **L4 phase 7** | The executable `tools/records/test/suite-06-rqm.sh` (`L4-P7-T10`) invokes; charter DoD-8 |
| `tools/records/rqm-contract.yaml`, `rqm-detect` | **L2** | The classification the board automation runs before calling Phase 3's `rqm-emit` |
| `metrics/attention/calibration.yaml` | **L0** | The calibrated-configuration register the §84.6 line 7478 threshold review refits |
| `metrics/attention/derived-metrics.yaml` | **L0**, and the metric-register phase | The ledger's half of the §97.1 line 8838 store-naming rule; ids here never duplicate `metrics/register/**` |
| `metrics/attention/validate-attention-config.sh`, `validate-store-naming.sh` | **L0** | Two status checks for the integration gate |
| `instrument_defect` and the three eligibility flags | **L3** | The drift finding of §97.4 line 8976; `validators/drift/**` is L3 (PARTITION.md line 19) |
| `metrics/attention/HANDOFF-P.md` | **L0** | The contract for whoever receives subsystem P — unassigned in PARTITION v1 |
| The DevLake ingest dependency in `sources.yaml` | **L0**, routing to **L5** | Engineering and Review windows in production; `ops-vm/**` is L5 (PARTITION.md line 21) |

## 11. Standing rules — this phase only

The lane charter's §12 applies in full. Five rules bind this phase in particular:

1. **No threshold is a literal in code.** Every one is read from `metrics/attention/calibration.yaml`, and check **C8** of `validate-attention-config.sh` proves every `.py` under `metrics/attention/` reads it. D102 (line 10195) requires each to be *"defined once, with the calibrated-configuration convention and a stated initial value."*
2. **Never retune a threshold to make a task pass.** A refit is a §84.6 line 7478 calibration review — evidenced, dated, and run at the six- or twelve-month cadence — never an edit during a build. A number that will not come out is a defect in the derivation, not in the threshold.
3. **Never a ninth category, and never a flag promoted to one.** §67.2 line 5579: *"no parallel category set exists anywhere in the operating system."* `unplanned` and `ritual` are flags; founder coordination time is a sum, not a category (line 5594).
4. **A metric that cannot name its store does not ship.** §97.1 line 8838. It is absent from `derived-metrics.yaml`, not present-and-flagged, and a figure `derive.py` emits with no nameable store is a blocker for L0, not an invented store.
5. **L4 emits; it does not render.** No Capacity Profile, no workload state, no Founder view, no per-person surface, no drift finding — those are subsystem P (unassigned) and L3. §67.3 line 5605 and §91.2 (lines 8083–8092): attention hours are never individual performance evidence and never a per-person drill-down on a general surface.
