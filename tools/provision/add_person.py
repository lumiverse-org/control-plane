"""L3-P4-09: the `add-person` orchestrator (spec 12.6, 12.1; §36.4 `ai_restrictions`; AT-002).

Section 12.6, quoted verbatim (see `lanes/L3-04-provisioning.md` line 1641,
carried forward here since L3-06 supersedes L3-04's task *structure*, not
the spec text it quotes): *"`add person` produces: `people.yaml` entry;
organisation invitation; Team membership per assignments; capability
grants; AI runtime assignment honouring per-product `ai_restrictions`;
onboarding checklist issue; and registration in the review network
view."* That is seven named outputs, in this order. Section 12.1 adds one
further, separate act on top of those seven: *"the encryption key for
their self-view document, handed once, in person"* -- a manual step with
no API for it, `self_view_key_exchange`.

**Known contradiction in this task's own text (`lanes/L3-06-tasks.md`,
L3-P4-09), flagged rather than silently resolved:** the task prose calls
the above "seven automated steps ... Plus one manual step" (7 + 1 = 8),
but the task's own Acceptance/SELF-VERIFY block requires the dry-run
summary line to read exactly `PLAN add-person steps=7 writes=0 manual=1`
-- a *total* of 7. Both cannot be true of a plan holding all eight
concepts as separate steps. This module resolves the arithmetic (not the
substance) by folding the two least individually load-bearing outputs --
`onboarding_checklist_issue` and `register_review_network_view`, both
"day one" registration actions that happen together once Team membership
and capability grants have landed -- into one step,
`onboarding_and_review_registration`. Every one of the eight named
concepts is still produced (see that step's description and
`onboarding_checklist()` below, which independently renders the
onboarding-issue content); none is dropped, only two are co-located in
one `Step`. See `notes` in this task's own hand-off record for the same
flag raised to a human integrator.

Like `change_role.py` (L3-P7-01) and `remove_person.py` (L3-P7-02), every
step here is declarative (§101 invariant 55): this operation edits
registry declared state (or, for `org_invitation`, performs the one
direct act Section 12.1 assigns to `add-person` itself rather than to
reconciliation) and leaves any further GitHub-side convergence to
reconciliation. `org_invitation` grants **base Read only** -- the
organisation's default member permission -- and nothing here grants
Write directly: `team_membership_per_assignments` is the only step whose
description names a Write grant, and it is Team-derived (§11.2), never a
direct repository grant.
