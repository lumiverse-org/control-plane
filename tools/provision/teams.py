"""L3-P4-05: Team creator derived from the registries.

Spec basis: Section 11.2 -- "One Team per product ... Two
organisation-wide Teams grant Write to the Team Lead role and the QA
role. Team membership is derived from the registries" -- and Section
98.2 Phase 1.

`plan_teams(registries)` plans:

* one Team per product, named for the product, containing every
  person who holds a current assignment on it;
* exactly two organisation-wide Teams, `team-lead` and `qa`, one per
  role.

Membership is always **derived** from `people.yaml` / `product.yaml`,
never accepted from a caller: `Team()` itself refuses to be
constructed with an explicit member list (`CallerSuppliedMembership`)
and can only be built through `Team.derived(...)`, the constructor
`plan_teams` itself uses. This mirrors `tools/provision/codeowners.py`
(L3-P4-02)'s own "no caller-supplied identity list" discipline and
uses the *same* Team-Lead/QA derivation rule that module documents:
the current holder of the `reviewer-matrix-change` capability is
Team Lead; the current holder of the `verification` capability is QA.
Neither role name is a literal in `people.yaml` -- both are read off
capabilities, which is what "derived from the registries" means here.
