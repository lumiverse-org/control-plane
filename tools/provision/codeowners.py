"""L3-P4-02: CODEOWNERS generator, human identities only.

Spec basis: Section 11.3 -- "CODEOWNERS is generated to contain human
identities only -- no machine account ever appears in it" -- and the
four-rule ownership table transcribed below, verbatim in order:

    1. Product source paths are owned by the product Team.
    2. `verification/` is owned by whoever holds `verification_responsibility`.
    3. `product.yaml` is owned by the Team Lead role.
    4. Migration directories and CI workflow files are owned by the Team Lead role.

Every candidate owner is checked against `people.yaml` before it is
ever written to an output line: a login absent from `people.yaml`, or
matching the machine-identity pattern this codebase uses everywhere
else (`reconciler/comparators/codeowners.py`'s own convention -- a
`[bot]`-suffixed login, or a login with no `people.yaml` entry at all)
raises `MachineIdentityInCodeowners` rather than being emitted. No
machine approval can ever satisfy a CODEOWNERS-gated review this way
(Section 37.3, D53).

`generate(product, registries)` is the fixture-facing entry point the
CLI and the Phase-6 repair path (`L3-P6-04`) call: "Regenerate through
`tools.provision.codeowners.generate` -- one generator, never two."
`generate_from_registry` is the pure function underneath it, taking
already-loaded `product.yaml` content and the `people.yaml` list
directly -- this is what tests exercise to inject a machine login
without needing a second on-disk fixture.

Team-handle convention: this module has no organisation name to build
a `@org/team-slug` CODEOWNERS reference from (no fixture or registry
in this lane declares one), so it references the product Team and the
two organisation-wide role Teams `L3-P4-05` (`tools/provision/teams.py`)
plans by a bare handle: `@team-<product>` for the product Team,
`@team-lead` and `@qa` for the two organisation-wide Teams. If an
organisation name is ever declared, only this constant changes.
