"""L3-P4-01: the provisioning plan model (spec Section 7 preamble, §12.6).

Every provisioning operation (`create-product`, `add-person`,
`change-role`, `remove-person`) builds one ``Plan`` of ``Step``s before it
does anything else. A ``Plan`` never performs a mutation itself -- it is
the thing a CLI command prints in ``--dry-run`` mode, and the thing an
``--apply --live`` run walks step by step, recording which steps actually
executed.

The dry-run summary line every Phase-4 operation prints is fixed by
Section 7's preamble:

    PLAN <operation> steps=<int> writes=<int> manual=<int>

``writes`` is the count of mutations *actually performed* -- in
``--dry-run`` (the default, always, per L3-P4-01) it is ``0``. ``manual``
is the count of steps of kind ``manual``: the tracked issues a plan
emits wherever the provider offers no automation (Section 19.1), so a
manual step is never silently missing from the plan.
