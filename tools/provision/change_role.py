"""L3-P7-01: the `change-role` operation (spec 12.6, 12.3; invariant 56; AT-005).

Composes the plan in exactly the §12.6 order, seven steps: role_update,
capability_recalculation, permission_recalculation,
reviewer_matrix_reassessment, ownership_reassessment_prompt,
incident_responder_reassessment, dashboard_update. Every step is
declarative (§101 invariant 55: "Ownership changes are declarative and
take effect through reconciliation") - this operation edits registry
declared state and leaves the actual GitHub-side mutation to
reconciliation; nothing here calls a provisioning credential directly.

Two hard rules, both from §74 and §101 invariants 36-38:

1. `ownership_reassessment_prompt` posts a request for a human to look
   at `login`'s ownership assignments - it never reassigns anything
   itself. `ownership_reassessment_prompt()` below is the only function
   that builds that request, and it returns an `OwnershipReassessmentPrompt`
   (a message), never a mutated ownership record.
2. AT-071 requires that no code path here ever reach any formal,
   named-in-that-acceptance-test people decision. `_refuse_personnel_action`
   below is the single place this module names any of those five words -
   see its own `_FORBIDDEN_ROLE_TOKENS` tuple for the literal list; every
   other line in this file, including this docstring, deliberately says
   "a formal people decision" instead of repeating them.
