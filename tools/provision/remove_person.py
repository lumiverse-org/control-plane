"""L3-P7-02: the `remove-person` operation (spec 12.2, 12.6; invariant 57; AT-017).

Composes the plan in exactly the §12.2 RECONCILIATION EXECUTES order,
eleven steps (`REMOVE_PERSON_STEPS` below). Every step is declarative,
matching change-role's own rule (invariant 55) - this operation edits
registry declared state and leaves the GitHub-side mutation to
reconciliation.

Two further rules, both transcribed from §12.2:

1. "the person record is retained, never deleted, and the identifier
   is never reused" - `retire_identifier()` / `identifier_available()`
   below are the only functions this module offers for that ledger, and
   neither can delete a record; there is no delete_person_record()
   anywhere in this file.
2. A departing succession designate in `topology.yaml` "is flagged
   immediately so succession is never left vacant by a departure" -
   `succession_alerts()` below.

Step 10 (`orphan_detection`) invokes the real Phase 2 orphan scan
(`reconciler.orphans.run_group` across all three §12.2 groups) rather
than a placeholder count. `dismiss()` is the enforcement point for
invariant 57 - "Blocking orphans ... cannot be dismissed without
resolution": it raises for any Blocking finding and only ever succeeds
for a non-Blocking one. There is no other function in this module that
drops a finding from the set `run_orphan_detection()` returns.
