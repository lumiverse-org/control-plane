"""Push-list guard (Spec Sections 92.11, 97.3; D79).

Rules, all mechanical:
  P1 route_id equals the filename stem
  P2 push_class is one of the eight closed Section 92.11 classes
  P3 the distinct push_class set is exactly those eight
  P4 every route names a non-empty event_type and taxonomy_source
  P5 destination_channel is non-empty and is a configuration-backed channel
     name, never a literal destination
  P6 pending_founder_decision declares the D79 coalescing rule
  P7 every event_type resolves in registries/platform.yaml when that file
     exists (read-only consumption of an L1-owned registry; skipped with a
     printed marker when absent -- boundary rule B-4)
