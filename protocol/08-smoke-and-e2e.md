# 08 — Smoke and End-to-End Verification

**Status:** binding. Part of the verification and merge protocol for the five-lane parallel build.
**Owner:** L0 Integrator (per `PARTITION.md`, L0 owns `main`, `integration`, `docs/**`, root files).
**Applies to:** every promotion of `integration` → `main`, and once as the V1 exit gate.

---

## 0. What this document is

Files 01–07 of this protocol verify that each lane built *something that passes its own tests*. This file
verifies that the five lanes built **the same system**. It does that the only way that cannot be faked: it
takes one pilot product from nothing, through create-product, a real change through Gate 1 and Gate 2, a
real artifact with a real digest, staging, verification, production approval, production deploy, and then
demands that the assembled estate answer **all eleven questions of spec Section 32** about that artifact,
from records the run itself caused to be written.

Five low-cost developers on five branches, none holding full context, can each pass their lane's unit tests
and still produce a system where the digest that reaches production is not the digest staging verified,
where the deployment record is written by a workflow nobody reads, where `/version` reports something no
record mentions. Nothing catches that except walking the whole chain once, for real, and refusing to accept
any link on assertion.

**The demonstration is the deliverable.** A green E2E run is what makes the claim "V1 is real" a fact rather
than an aggregate of five lanes' self-reports.

### 0.1 The principle that governs every gate in this file

> A check that can only pass is not a check.

The specification holds this in at least four places, and this protocol carries all four into the test
strategy:

| Where the spec holds it | What it says | Carried here as |
|---|---|---|
| Section 53.1, the seeded-canary rule | A reconciliation run that reports zero findings, **including the planted canary**, is a FAILED run — it proves the instrument stopped looking | Stage E2E-12 + `NEG-18` |
| **AT-102** | "a reconciler that finds nothing is assumed broken, never assumed clean"; raises SIG-13 and triggers the gap procedure | `CP-1201`, `CP-1202` |
| Section 31.2, the seeded-defect case | "A verification contract that cannot fail is not a contract." Every `verification/contract.yaml` declares a seeded defect the contract MUST fail; a run where it passes is a FAILED run, raises SIG-18, Blocking for that product | Stage E2E-03 + `NEG-04` |
| Section 30.2 / Section 23 culture notes | Zero plan-checker rejections means the gates are not working; a very low code-review rejection rate may mean rubber-stamping | `NEG-05`…`NEG-08`, and §7.3 |

Therefore **every gate exercised in this file has a paired negative test** that drives the gate into
failure on purpose and asserts that it failed *for the stated reason*. §5 is that suite. A run in which the
positive path is green and the negative suite is also green **is a failed run**, and §7.2 says so
mechanically.

### 0.2 Scope boundary

| In scope | Out of scope |
|---|---|
| One pilot product, end to end, on the assembled `integration` branch | Per-lane unit and contract tests (files 01–07) |
| The eleven evidence questions of Section 32 | The people tier (AT-052…AT-088) — no people data exists at V1 (Section 99.4, item 9) |
| The gates a change actually passes through: Gate 1, Gate 2, production approval, digest immutability, parity, freeze | Predictive economics, forecasting, Layer B decision support (deferred, Section 99.4) |
| The instruments those gates read: verification contract, reconciler, records stores | Split / merge / transfer processes (deferred, Section 99.4) |
| Access-boundary execution: AT-108, AT-109, AT-110 | Full 110-test acceptance sweep — this file runs the subset a delivery chain touches (§1.2) |

## 1. The demonstration contract

### 1.1 What a passing run proves

| Stage | Proves | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| E2E-01 create-product | Adding a product is configuration plus onboarding, never platform redesign; every surface enumerates from the registry | **AT-001**, invariant **#53** |
| E2E-02 assignment and reconcile | Declared state reaches the estate; CODEOWNERS and Team membership are derived, not hand-edited | invariants **#7**, **#55** |
| E2E-03 verification contract | No onboarded product without a verification contract, and the contract can fail | Section 31.2, invariant **#1**, SIG-18 |
| E2E-04 Gate 1 | A plan is approved by a holder of `plan-approval`, not by its author; the approver is notified; turnaround is measured | **AT-106**, Section 26.1 |
| E2E-05 Gate 2 | Independent review by someone other than the author, approval of the most recent reviewable push | Invariants **#8**, **#9** |
| E2E-06 build | One immutable artifact, digest recorded, SBOM emitted beside it | Section 33.2, Section 48.3 |
| E2E-07 staging | Deployed, smoke passed, manual UAT recorded through RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT | Section 31, Section 97.2 |
| E2E-08 production approval | A separate event from Gate 2, by a named approver who is not the deployer | Invariant **#12**, Section 27.2 |
| E2E-09 production deploy | The **same digest**, never rebuilt; deployment record and event are required failing steps | Invariants **#22**, **#23**, Section 97.2 |
| E2E-10 evidence chain | All eleven questions answered from GitHub, Actions and Grafana alone; item 5 == item 11 | **Section 32** |
| E2E-11 rollback and restore | Rollback tested once, restore tested once, both recorded | **AT-103**, invariants **#3**, **#4**, **#27** |
| E2E-12 reconciliation | The reconciler runs, finds the canary, and records its comparison counts | **AT-102**, **AT-032**, **AT-033** |
| NEG suite (§5) | Every one of the above gates is able to fail, and fails for the right reason | §0.1 |

### 1.2 Acceptance tests this run executes for real

These are executed by this file, not asserted elsewhere:
**AT-001**, **AT-009**, **AT-032**, **AT-033**, **AT-036**, **AT-037**, **AT-039**,
**AT-102**, **AT-103**, **AT-106**, **AT-108**, **AT-109**, **AT-110**.

Referenced but executed elsewhere in the protocol: AT-023…AT-027 (platform change, file 07),
AT-047/AT-048/AT-104 (support intake, file 06), AT-035 (org export, file 06),
AT-089…AT-100 (access separation, file 05).

### 1.3 Invariants this run asserts mechanically

**#1**, **#2**, **#3**, **#4**, **#6**, **#7**, **#8**, **#9**, **#12**, **#18**, **#21**, **#22**, **#23**,
**#25**, **#27**, **#28**, **#40**, **#41**, **#44**, **#46**, **#47**, **#53**, **#55**, **#71**, **#72**,
**#77**, **#79**, **#80**, **#81**, **#84**, **#85**, **#87**, **#111**.

Each is bound to a checkpoint id in the traceability matrix, §10.

## 2. Fixtures: the pilot product and the actors

### 2.1 The pilot product

The run creates a real product and then leaves it in place. It is not torn down: it becomes the estate's
permanent canary product, and its records are the reference answers every later run diffs against.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `identity.id` | `pilot-one` |
| Repository | `org/pilot-one-api` (single repository, `role: primary`, `deploys: true`) |
| `conformance_profile` | `service` — so the three endpoints of Section 41.2 and items 10/11 of Section 32 apply unsubstituted |
| `classification.reliability_criticality` | `high` — this makes the performance mechanism **required** (Section 31.3), so the run exercises it |
| `verification.performance` | `required` |
| `deployment.artifact_type` | `docker-image`, registry `ghcr.io/org/pilot-one` |
| `deployment.progressive_delivery` | `flag-gated` |
| `reversibility_default` | `fully-reversible` |
| `observability.telemetry_exposure` | `private-authenticated` |
| `recovery:` block | present — which is what makes **AT-103** in scope for this product |

`org/pilot-one-api` is a service that serves one route plus the three required endpoints. It is deliberately
trivial. The subject of the test is the delivery chain, not the product.

The change driven through the chain — **the pilot change** — is: *add a `disabled_at` timestamp to the
customer record and a `POST /customers/{id}/disable` route*. It is chosen because it is the worked example
of Section 31, it touches database schema (so the plan-checker's rollback-strategy rule is exercised), and
it is `fully-reversible` (so the happy path is the standard flow and the reversibility negative tests in
§5 have a clean baseline to deviate from).

### 2.2 Minimum actor set

Section 27.2 requires the approving identity to differ from the deploying identity; Section 95.4 arms
"production approver ≠ deploying actor" at **3 humans with Write**. The E2E therefore needs:

| Actor | Registry id | Holds | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author | `dev-a` | `primary_owner` on `pilot-one` | writes the plan and the code |
| Independent reviewer | `dev-b` | `cross_reviewer`, `code-review` | Gate 2 |
| Plan approver | `lead-1` | `plan-approval` | Gate 1 |
| Verification authority | `qa-1` | `verification`, `release-signoff` | staging UAT, verification block |
| Production approver | `lead-1` | `production-approval` | E2E-08 — must not be `dev-a`, must not be the pipeline |
| Executor | `devops-1` | `devops` | runs create-product |

**STOP rule S-01.** If fewer than three humans hold Write on `org/pilot-one-api`, the armed configuration
cannot be exercised. Do **not** run the E2E with the gates unarmed and record a pass. Run the bootstrap
variant of §8.4 instead, which explicitly records which gates were *not* proven and files the shortfall as
a bootstrap exception under Section 95.2. A gate that appears to be working and is not is the exact failure
Section 95.1 names.

### 2.3 Credentials the run may and may not touch

| Credential | Used by | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `records-writer` GitHub App token | deploy / UAT / reconcile workflows | fine-grained `contents: write`, **`control-plane-records` only**, reaches no registry (Section 97.1, D89). Asserted at `CP-0904`. |
| reconciler credential | reconciliation job | bounded — proven by **AT-110** at `CP-1210`, executed for real, not asserted |
| ops console credential | founder ops console | read-only — proven by **AT-108** at `CP-1310` |
| any human-held production credential | — | **none exists**. `env \| grep -i -E 'api_key|token|secret'` returns empty on every operator machine (Section 95.3). Asserted at `CP-0002`. |

---

## 3. Harness conventions

### 3.1 Location and ownership

The harness lives in the **control-plane** repository at `e2e/`, owned by **L0** in `CODEOWNERS`. It is not
a lane path, so it creates no lane-guard conflict and no lane may edit it (PARTITION rule 1).

```
e2e/
  run.sh                 # the only entry point
  lib/checkpoint.sh      # cp_assert / cp_refute / cp_equal
  stages/00-preflight.sh … stages/13-access.sh
  negative/neg-01.sh … negative/neg-22.sh
  fixtures/pilot-one/    # product.yaml, verification/, seeded defect, canary
  out/<run-id>/          # evidence bundle, gitignored, uploaded as an artifact
```

### 3.2 Checkpoint primitives

Every assertion in this file is one of three primitives. They are the whole contract between the stages and
the pass/fail rule in §7.

```bash
# e2e/lib/checkpoint.sh
set -euo pipefail

: "${E2E_RUN_ID:?run ./e2e/run.sh — never a stage script directly}"
export E2E_OUT="e2e/out/${E2E_RUN_ID}"
mkdir -p "${E2E_OUT}/evidence" "${E2E_OUT}/checkpoints"
E2E_LOG="${E2E_OUT}/checkpoints/log.tsv"

_emit() { printf '%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "$1" "$2" "$3" >>"${E2E_LOG}"; }

cp_pass() { _emit "$1" PASS "$2"; printf '  ok   %s  %s\n' "$1" "$2"; }
cp_fail() { _emit "$1" FAIL "$2"; printf '  FAIL %s  %s\n' "$1" "$2"; exit 1; }

# POSITIVE checkpoint: the command must succeed.
cp_assert() {
  local id="$1" what="$2"; shift 2
  if "$@" >"${E2E_OUT}/evidence/${id}.out" 2>&1; then
    cp_pass "$id" "$what"
  else
    cp_fail "$id" "$what — evidence: ${E2E_OUT}/evidence/${id}.out"
  fi
}

# EQUALITY checkpoint: two values must be byte-identical. Used for the digest chain.
cp_equal() {
  local id="$1" what="$2" a="$3" b="$4"
  printf 'expected=%s\nactual=%s\n' "$a" "$b" >"${E2E_OUT}/evidence/${id}.out"
  [ "$a" = "$b" ] && cp_pass "$id" "$what" || cp_fail "$id" "$what — '$a' != '$b'"
}

# NEGATIVE checkpoint: the command MUST fail, AND must fail for the stated reason.
# A negative test that fails for the wrong reason is not a negative test.
cp_refute() {
  local id="$1" what="$2" reason_re="$3"; shift 3
  if "$@" >"${E2E_OUT}/evidence/${id}.out" 2>&1; then
    cp_fail "$id" "GATE DID NOT FIRE — '$what' succeeded and must not have"
  elif grep -Eq "$reason_re" "${E2E_OUT}/evidence/${id}.out"; then
    cp_pass "$id" "gate fired: $what refused, reason matched /$reason_re/"
  else
    cp_fail "$id" "WRONG REASON — '$what' failed, but not on /$reason_re/; the gate may be broken rather than working"
  fi
}
```

`cp_refute`'s third argument is not decoration. A negative test that passes because the network was down,
the CLI was missing or a YAML file was malformed proves nothing about the gate. The reason regex is what
makes the negative suite itself a check that can fail.

### 3.3 Numbering

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CP-SSNN` | positive checkpoint, stage `SS`, sequence `NN` (e.g. `CP-0903` = stage E2E-09, third checkpoint) |
| `NEG-NN` | negative test, §5 |
| `S-NN` | STOP rule |

### 3.4 Entry point

```bash
# e2e/run.sh
set -euo pipefail
export E2E_RUN_ID="${E2E_RUN_ID:-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)}"

# know to export by hand.
export E2E_FIRST_RUN="${E2E_FIRST_RUN:-0}"
export E2E_BOOTSTRAP="${E2E_BOOTSTRAP:-0}"
for arg in "$@"; do
  case "$arg" in

  esac
done

source e2e/lib/checkpoint.sh

for s in e2e/stages/*.sh;   do echo "== $s"; bash "$s" || break; done
for n in e2e/negative/*.sh; do
  # §8.4 bootstrap variant: skip and explicitly record as unproven the independence gates.
  case "$n" in
    */neg-09.sh|*/neg-10.sh|*/neg-12.sh|*/neg-13.sh)
      if [ "${E2E_BOOTSTRAP}" = "1" ]; then
        echo "== $n (skipped — bootstrap: independence gate unarmed, recorded unproven per §8.4)"
        continue
      fi
      ;;
  esac
  echo "== $n"; bash "$n" || break
done
bash e2e/verdict.sh          # §7 — the only thing allowed to print PASS for the run; `|| break` above keeps a
                              # stage/negative failure from killing this script under `set -e`, so verdict.sh —
                              # and its VERDICT: FAIL — always runs and its exit code is what run.sh returns
```

**Stages run in order and stop on first failure.** The chain is a chain: there is no useful information in
stage 9 when stage 6 did not produce a digest.

## 4. The end-to-end script

### E2E-00 — Preflight

```

**STOP rule S-02.** `CP-0004` failing means a `workflows/*` tag moved. Do not continue and do not "just
re-pin": a moved tag executes new code in every product's pipeline with no pull request and no diff
(Section 33.2), it is **Blocking** drift on the Section 53.1 row, and it is investigated before anything
else merges.

### E2E-10 — The eleven questions

This is the stage the whole file exists for. Section 32 says the system answers eleven questions using
**only GitHub, GitHub Actions and Grafana**. The assembler therefore runs with no other data source, and
each answer must be non-empty and must cite the record it came from.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# e2e/stages/10-evidence-chain.sh
source e2e/lib/checkpoint.sh
DIGEST="$(cat "${E2E_OUT}/digest")"

./tools/evidence/evidence-chain \
  --product "${E2E_PRODUCT}" --digest "${DIGEST}" \
  --sources github,actions,grafana --deny-other-sources \
  --format json > "${E2E_OUT}/evidence/chain.json"

cp_assert CP-1000 "evidence-chain assembled from the three permitted sources only" \
  jq -e '.sources | inside(["github","actions","grafana"])' "${E2E_OUT}/evidence/chain.json"
```

| Q | Question (Section 32) | Assertion | Checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Which git commit? | `.q1.commit` equals the merge SHA, cited to the artifact label **and** the deployment record | `CP-1001` |
| 2 | Which pull request? | `.q2.pr` resolves from commit-to-PR association and equals the run's PR | `CP-1002` |
| 3 | Who approved at Gate 2, and in which role? | `.q3.approver == "dev-b"`, `.q3.role == "cross_reviewer"`, cross-referenced against the assignment registry — not read off the PR alone | `CP-1003` |
| 4 | Which CI run produced it? | `.q4.run_url` is a real run whose head SHA is `.q1.commit` | `CP-1004` |
| 5 | What is the artifact digest? | `.q5.digest` equals `${DIGEST}`, sourced from the registry digest recorded at build | `CP-1005` |
| 6 | When deployed to staging? | `.q6.staging_deployed_at` present, UTC with offset | `CP-1006` |
| 7 | Did staging verification pass? | `.q7.smoke == "pass"` **and** `.q7.uat_record` points at a real `records/uat/` file | `CP-1007` |
| 8 | Who approved production? | `.q8.approver == "lead-1"`, from the records store, **verified by the workflow-identity gate** | `CP-1008` |
| 9 | When deployed to production? | `.q9.production_deployed_at` present | `CP-1009` |
| 10 | Did post-deployment smoke pass? | `.q10.smoke == "pass"`, attached to the deployment | `CP-1010` |
| 11 | What digest is running right now? | `.q11.digest` read live from `GET /version` | `CP-1011` |

**The eleven checks below are the literal table above, one line each (B-17) — not a generic
presence loop.** A loop keyed on "some field of `.q$q` is non-null" can never fail on `q6` or
`q9`: neither `.value`, `.digest`, `.approver`, `.commit`, `.pr`, `.run_url` nor `.smoke` is the
field either question actually carries (`staging_deployed_at`, `production_deployed_at`), so
both checkpoints would report PASS on a `null` answer forever, unconditionally.

## 5. The negative suite — every gate proven able to fail

**`NEG-<nn>` below is not the canonical negative-test namespace** — `GATE-L<n>-<nnn>` is (FD-098, A3; `00-test-strategy.md` §4.1 rule 8). `NEGATIVE-TEST-CONCORDANCE.md` maps every `NEG-<nn>` onto its `GATE-L<n>-<nnn>` equivalent.

Each entry drives a gate into failure deliberately and asserts the refusal reason. **The suite runs on a
disposable branch and a disposable tag against the pilot product; nothing here reaches `main`.** Every one
uses `cp_refute`, so a gate that silently permits the forbidden act fails the run.

| ID | Gate under test | The deliberate violation | Must be refused because | Spec / test |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| NEG-03 | `/version` match | Deploy, then hot-patch the running container | `verify-digest-chain` mismatch → P0 | §32 item 11, §99.2 F |

| NEG-08 | Plan-checker | Submit a plan adding a slopsquat package name | legitimacy check against live registry API | §30.2, §33.2 |
| NEG-09 | Gate 1 independence | `dev-a` approves `dev-a`'s own plan | Gate 1 admits no self-approval | §26.1 |
| NEG-10 | Gate 2 independence | Author approves own PR | approval of most recent reviewable push by a non-author | Inv **#8**, **#9** |
| NEG-11 | Gate 2 staleness | Approve, then push a new commit, then merge | approval invalidated by the new push | Inv **#9** |
| NEG-12 | Read-only approval | A Read-permission holder approves | Read approval does not satisfy protection | §95.4 |
| NEG-13 | Production self-approval | The approver dispatches the deploy | workflow-identity gate: approver == deployer | §27.2, Inv **#12** |
| NEG-14 | Production approval ordering | Approve production before staging verification completes | approval is against a staging-verified digest only | §27 |
| NEG-15 | Verification block | Raise a verification block, then attempt production deploy | fail-closed while an open block exists | §27 |
| NEG-16 | Environment ref policy | Push a branch declaring `environment: production` and dispatch it | deployment branch/tag policy rejects the ref | §33.4 |
| NEG-17 | Record write path | Attempt a `records/**` write with the reconciler credential | records-writer only; reconciler is bounded | §97.1, **AT-110** |
| NEG-18 | Reconciler canary | Remove the seeded canary from the comparison set and run | zero findings = FAILED run, SIG-13 | **AT-102**, §53.1 |
| NEG-19 | Required-check integrity | Add an `if:` path filter to a job emitting a required check | `skipped`/`neutral` on a required context is Blocking | §33.2 |
| NEG-20 | Tag pin integrity | Move a `workflows/*` tag onto a new SHA | tag ruleset blocks update/delete, empty bypass list | §33.2, §53.1 |
| NEG-21 | Renovate path guard | Push a lockfile-only commit authored by a non-Renovate identity to a Renovate branch | authorship half of the guard | §33.2 |
| NEG-22 | Friday freeze | Dispatch a production deploy at 15:30 declared-calendar Friday | freeze gate, resolved against the declared calendar | §34.2, §97.1 |
| NEG-23 | Machine authority | Machine account attempts merge / approve / deploy | actor gate, GitHub-side | Inv **#18**, §37.3 |

| NEG-26 | Auto-repair direction | Ask auto-repair to move toward a looser control | stricter-only, enforced in code | Inv **#81**, **AT-033** |
| NEG-27 | Deployment record | Make the record write fail, then deploy | record write is a required failing step | §97.2 |

    --digest "$(cat "${E2E_OUT}/digest")" --simulate-calendar-time "friday 15:30"
```

**NEG-18b matters.** Restoring the canary and finding it again is what stops NEG-18 from being satisfied by
a reconciler that is simply broken. Every destructive negative test in this suite pairs with a restore
assertion; `verdict.sh` fails the run if any `--remove`/`--restore` pair is unbalanced in the log.

---

## 6. What the evidence bundle contains

`e2e/out/<run-id>/` is uploaded as a workflow artifact and its manifest is committed to
`records/e2e/<run-id>.yaml` in `control-plane-records`, written by `records-writer`.

```yaml
# records/e2e/<run-id>.yaml
record_schema_version: 1
id: E2E-2026-08-27-001
product: pilot-one
timestamp: 2026-08-27T09:14:22Z          # UTC with offset, per Section 97.1
integration_sha: <sha>
digest: sha256:<64>
checkpoints_total: 118
checkpoints_passed: 118
negative_tests_total: 28
negative_tests_fired: 28                  # every gate refused what it must refuse
evidence_chain: answered                  # all eleven, with q5 == q11
acceptance_tests_executed: [AT-001, AT-009, AT-032, AT-033, AT-036,
                            AT-037, AT-039, AT-102, AT-103, AT-106,
                            AT-108, AT-109, AT-110]
verdict: PASS
```

Retention: permanent. E2E records are canonical operational records under Section 97 and are append-only —
a correction is a follow-up record, never an edit (invariant **#47**).

---

## 7. The verdict rule

```bash
set -euo pipefail
# e2e/verdict.sh
source e2e/lib/checkpoint.sh
fails=$(awk -F'\t' '$3=="FAIL"' "${E2E_LOG}" | wc -l)
pos=$(awk  -F'\t' '$2 ~ /^CP-/  && $3=="PASS"' "${E2E_LOG}" | wc -l)
neg=$(awk  -F'\t' '$2 ~ /^NEG-/ && $3=="PASS"' "${E2E_LOG}" | wc -l)

[ "$fails" -eq 0 ] || { echo "VERDICT: FAIL — ${fails} checkpoint failures"; echo "GATE-RESULT gate=E2E-VERDICT level=T3 assertions=$((pos+neg)) failures=${fails} negatives_run=${neg} negatives_that_failed_correctly=${neg}"; exit 1; }
[ "$neg" -ge 28 ]  || { echo "VERDICT: FAIL — only ${neg}/28 gates were proven able to fail"; echo "GATE-RESULT gate=E2E-VERDICT level=T3 assertions=$((pos+neg)) failures=0 negatives_run=${neg} negatives_that_failed_correctly=${neg}"; exit 1; }
[ "$pos" -ge 118 ] || { echo "VERDICT: FAIL — only ${pos}/118 positive checkpoints ran"; echo "GATE-RESULT gate=E2E-VERDICT level=T3 assertions=$((pos+neg)) failures=0 negatives_run=${neg} negatives_that_failed_correctly=${neg}"; exit 1; }
echo "VERDICT: PASS — ${pos} checkpoints, ${neg} gates proven able to fail"
echo "GATE-RESULT gate=E2E-VERDICT level=T3 assertions=$((pos+neg)) failures=0 negatives_run=${neg} negatives_that_failed_correctly=${neg}"
```

`VERDICT:` is retained as the penultimate, human-readable line; `GATE-RESULT` (`00-test-strategy.md` §3, FD-098 A2) is the mandatory terminal line every caller of `verdict.sh` parses.

### 7.1 Three ways to fail

1. **A positive checkpoint failed.** The chain is broken at that link. Stop; §8.3 routes it.
2. **A negative test did not fire.** A gate permitted what it exists to forbid. This is more serious than
   (1): the happy path may be entirely green while the system has no gate at all.
3. **A negative test fired for the wrong reason.** `cp_refute`'s reason regex did not match. The act was
   refused, but not by the control under test — which means the control is untested and may be absent.

### 7.2 The rule that makes this file honest

**A run with 118 green checkpoints and zero fired gates is a FAILED run.** The count of *gates proven able
to fail* is a first-class pass condition, exactly as Section 53.1 makes the canary a pass condition of a
reconciliation run and Section 31.2 makes the seeded defect a pass condition of a verification contract.
`verdict.sh` enforces it above; it is not a convention.

### 7.3 Rejection rates as a standing instrument

The E2E is one run. Over time the same principle applies to the live estate, and file 09 of this protocol
reads these from the event log:

| Instrument | Reading that means the gate is not working |
|---|---|
| Plan-checker rejections (`plan_rejected` events) | **Zero over a review period** — no plan-checker that rejects nothing is checking anything (Section 30.2) |
| Gate 2 change-requested rate | **Very low may mean rubber-stamping** rather than quality (Section 23) |
| Reconciliation findings | Zero including the canary → **failed**, SIG-13, gap procedure (**AT-102**) |
| Verification-contract seeded case | Last run passed → **SIG-18**, Blocking for that product (Section 31.2) |
| Write freshness on `events/`, `records/deployments/`, `records/uat/` | Past interval → Blocking; zero-shaped metrics are indistinguishable from health (Section 97.2) |

---

## 8. When this runs, and what happens when it doesn't pass

### 8.1 Cadence

| Trigger | Scope |
|---|---|
| Every `integration` → `main` promotion | Full run: E2E-00 … E2E-13 plus the whole negative suite |
| Every merge-train cycle completing (L1 → L4 → L2 → L3 → L5) | Stages E2E-00 … E2E-03 plus NEG-04, NEG-18, NEG-19 — the instrument checks, which are the ones that go quiet |
| Once, as the V1 exit gate | Full run, with the evidence bundle presented as the V1 acceptance artifact |
| Nightly on `integration` | **Instrument checks only** — the same E2E-00 … E2E-03 plus NEG-04, NEG-18, NEG-19 as the merge-train-cycle row above — non-blocking, findings filed as issues |

The full run is a **required status check on the `integration` → `main` pull request**. It is emitted by a
job carrying no `if:` and no path filter (Section 33.2), for the reason NEG-19 tests.

**Safety contract (B-16): the full run is never scheduled unattended.** The full run executes a production deploy, rollback and restore, a deliberate hot-patch of a running container (NEG-03), a Friday-freeze breach attempt (NEG-22) and a move of a `workflows/*` tag every product consumes (NEG-20) — the class of action §8.2 restricts to L0 the Integrator acting directly, not to a cron trigger with nobody watching. Running that set nightly with no operator present is the same defect §5's "nothing here reaches `main`" claim exists to rule out, applied to a schedule instead of a branch: it is unattended precisely where the consequence of a stuck mutation or a broken restore is highest. The full run therefore runs only at the three triggers above that already have an operator (the promotion PR, the V1 exit gate) or a bounded lane-cycle context — never on a bare nightly cron. Nightly coverage is the instrument-checks-only row, matching the merge-train-cycle row exactly, because those are read-only-classification checks whose only failure mode is "went quiet," not a live mutation left half-done with nobody to notice.

### 8.2 Who runs it

L0 the Integrator. No lane runs it, no lane can edit it, and no lane's green CI substitutes for it. A lane
whose work breaks a checkpoint learns so from an L0-filed blocker issue naming the checkpoint id, not from
a merge conflict.

### 8.3 Routing a failure back to a lane

Every checkpoint maps to exactly one owning lane. The blocker issue is filed against that lane with the
checkpoint id, the evidence file, and the spec clause.

| Checkpoint range | Owning lane (PARTITION) | Typical cause |
|---|---|---|
| `CP-01xx`, `CP-02xx`, `CP-12xx` | **L3** (`reconciler/**`, `tools/provision/**`, `validators/drift/**`) | scaffold gap, drift detection, canary |
| `CP-03xx`, `CP-05xx`, `CP-06xx`, `CP-07xx`, `CP-09xx`, `CP-10xx` | **L2** (`.github/workflows/**`, `templates/workflows/**`, `tools/evidence/**`) | pipeline, digest, evidence chain |
| `CP-0405`, `CP-0506`, `CP-0604`, `CP-07xx` record assertions, `CP-0904`, `CP-1016` | **L4** (records repo, `schemas/records/**`, `tools/records/**`) | record/event shape, write path, freshness |
| `CP-0301`, `CP-0302`, `CP-0306`, schema validation failures | **L1** (`schemas/**`, `registries/**`, `validators/registry/**`) | contract schema, validator |
| `CP-0106`, `CP-0107`, `CP-0206`, `CP-13xx` | **L5** (`access/**`, `infra/**`, `ops-vm/**`, `notify/**`) | protection, environments, cage, console |
| `CP-04xx` Gate 1 tooling, `CP-1000`…`CP-1015` assembly | **L0** (`contracts/**`, root, `e2e/**`) | contract drift or harness defect |

**STOP rule S-03.** A checkpoint failure is never resolved by editing the checkpoint. If the assertion is
believed wrong, that is a **Contract Change Request** to L0 (PARTITION rule 2), not a lane edit — and no
lane owns `e2e/**` in any case.

**STOP rule S-04.** A negative test that does not fire is **never** downgraded to a warning to unblock a
release. It is Blocking-class drift under Section 53.4 Level 4 and the promotion does not proceed.

### 8.4 The bootstrap variant

Where §2.2's actor set cannot be met (fewer than three humans with Write on the pilot repository), run
`./e2e/run.sh --bootstrap`. It:

1. runs every stage and every negative test **not** requiring gate independence;
2. **skips and explicitly records as unproven** NEG-09, NEG-10, NEG-12, NEG-13 — the independence gates;
3. writes `verdict: PASS-BOOTSTRAP` with an `unproven_gates:` list into the E2E record;
4. requires a matching bootstrap exception in `exceptions.yaml` with an expiry, an owner and a
   deactivation trigger (Section 95.2) — and fails if one is absent;
5. asserts everything Section 95.3 keeps binding even in bootstrap: digest immutability (`CP-0903`),
   the verification contract (`CP-0301`, `CP-0304`), the API-key-free environment (`CP-0002`),
   append-only history (`CP-1015`), and **the explicit production-approval event** (`CP-0804`) — because
   without that event the eleven questions are not answerable at all.

`PASS-BOOTSTRAP` is never reported as `PASS`. The activation checklist of Section 95.4 later cites this
record when it arms each gate, and arming re-runs the skipped negative tests for real.

---

## 9. What this file deliberately does not accept as evidence

| Not accepted | Why | What is accepted instead |
|---|---|---|
| A lane's own green CI | Five lanes each green proves nothing about the assembly | Checkpoints run against the assembled `integration` tip (`CP-0001`) |
| A screenshot, a chat message, a verbal confirmation | Not a record; nothing derives from it | A record in a Section 97.2 store, written by a workflow |
| A hand-edited record file | Records are generated; nobody transcribes (Section 97.1) | RECORD-VERIFICATION-RESULT dispatch (`CP-0707`, `CP-0709`) |
| A `skipped` required check | Branch protection counts it as satisfied while nothing ran | Real conclusion asserted (`CP-0502`) |
| A green reconciliation with zero findings | Proves the instrument stopped looking | Canary found and comparison counts recorded (`CP-1201`, `CP-1203`) |
| A verification contract that has never failed | Not a contract (Section 31.2) | Seeded defect rejected (`CP-0304`) and clean tree passed (`CP-0305`) |
| An asserted credential boundary | Section 99.6 risk 6: the most privileged identity's boundary must be executed | AT-110 executed (`CP-1210`), AT-108 (`CP-1310`), AT-109 (`CP-1311`) |
| A digest match at one hop | The chain must hold at every hop | Staging (`CP-0704`), production (`CP-0907`), chain (`CP-1012`), sweep (`CP-1014`) |

## 11. The one-paragraph statement this run earns

When `verdict.sh` prints `VERDICT: PASS` followed by its terminal `GATE-RESULT` line (§7), the following is a fact and not a claim: a product that did not
exist was created by one command; its assignments reached the estate through reconciliation rather than by
hand; a change passed a plan gate its author could not approve and a review gate its author could not
approve; it built exactly one artifact whose digest was recorded with its SBOM; that digest — and no other
— reached staging, passed smoke, passed a human's UAT recorded through a dispatch rather than a
conversation, and passed a performance threshold the product declared; a named human who was neither the
author nor the pipeline approved that specific digest for production; the pipeline deployed that same
digest without rebuilding it; the live service reports that digest at `/version`; all eleven questions of
Section 32 are answered from GitHub, Actions and Grafana with every answer citing a canonical store; a
rollback and a restore were each executed once and recorded; the reconciler found its planted canary; and
twenty-eight gates were each driven into failure on purpose and each refused, for the stated reason.

That is what "V1 is real rather than assembled" means, and this file is the only thing that says it.
